## Release making (for CGE engine or application, like castle-model-viewer)

- Test as described in RELEASE_MAKING_TESTS.md

- Bump versions:

    - For applications (like castle-model-viewer):

        - Make sure Version constant in the program's source code is incremented.

        - Make sure also CastleEngineManifest.xml <version value="..."/> is updated for a program.

    - For the engine, update version numbers in these files:

        - make sure to update to "X.<even>" for release
        - all ../castle-engine/packages/*.lpk
        - ../castle-engine/src/base/castleversion.inc
        - ../castle-engine/tools/build-tool/CastleEngineManifest.xml

           and recompile castle-engine tool:

           ```
           cd ../castle-engine/tools/build-tool
           ./castle-engine_compile.sh
           mv -f castle-engine ~/bin/
           castle-engine -v # check
           ```

        - ../castle-engine/doc/pasdoc/html-parts/body-end.php
          (and run "make clean && make" in doc/pasdoc/html-parts/ to refresh API docs extra HTML).
        - check: grep "7.0-alpha"

        - Change ../castle-engine/tools/internal/pack_release/github_update_release.txt
          to empty.
          Optional: hack Jenkinsfile to not do "Build Examples" as it takes some time.

- Call scripts/generate_versions.sh script.

  - Before, you should recompile program for the current (source) OS.
    That's because generate_versions.sh actually calls program with --version
    to determine version number.

  - You should run generate_versions script to update
    generated_versions.php (this makes version number on WWW page)
    generated_versions.sh (this makes version number for some binary archives, like on itch.io).

- Tag releases using scripts/make_tags.sh script.
  Leave uncommented only the lines for newly released programs, and run it.

- Make new releases from existing tags on GitHub, like

  https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/releases/new
  https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-image-viewer/releases/new
  https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-model-viewer/releases/new

  Save new release as merely a draft now.

- Uploading new release:

  - For castle-engine:
    Change ../castle-engine/tools/internal/pack_release/github_update_release.txt
    to proper release, like 7.0-alpha.2.
    Commit, push, wait for Jenkins.

  - For pasdoc, castle-model-viewer and most other projects under castle-engine org:
    Do it semi-automatically using scripts in cge-github-update-release:

    ssh jenkins.castle-engine.io
      sudo -u jenkins-cge-uploader -i
        # if cge-github-update-release missing:
        git clone git@gitlab.com:castle-engine/cge-github-update-release.git
        cd cge-github-update-release/

        # if cge-github-update-release present:
        cd cge-github-update-release/
        mr up

        # For castle-engine tools: adjust ./generic-update-github-releases
        ./generic-update-github-releases
        # For pasdoc:
        ./pasdoc-update-github-releases

    Note: This workflow is not perfect, since we upload the builds from latest (master)
    as the "last tagged" project version.
    In case there were some commits since make_tags.sh, the binary builds will be a bit newer.
    This is not a problem in practice, just be aware of it.
    Eventually, you can set tag again and force-push it (this is what cge-github-update-release
    also does to keep "snapshot" a moving tag).

  - Everything else:
    Manually upload to releases on GitHub latest builds by Jenkins of the appropriate application/engine.
    The Jenkinsfile for each project has perfect commands to make a build of every application,
    using advised FPC version etc. So we just upload these builds as releases.

- Publish releases on GitHub

- Update the URLs:
  - castle-model-viewer versions in htdocs/doc/castle-model-viewer.adoc (see lower about "how to update www content")

  - CGE links in `cge::download-engine[....]` in htdocs/doc/download.adoc ,
    update version/tag there.

    Note: If you change something outside of ADOC,
    to force regenerate https://castle-engine.io/download , on CGE SSH:

    ```
    cd ~/cge-www/htdocs/doc
    rm -f output/download.html
    make
    ```

  - Grep to make sure all things changed
    7.0-alpha.snapshot
    7.0-alpha-snapshot # mistake
    7.0-alpha.1
    7.0-alpha1 # mistake
    to make sure everything is updated.

  After:
  - Download.
    If you manually uploaded: also compare are the downloaded files the same.

- if you released new castle_game_engine version:
  - make sure new apidoc is already uploaded.

      Alt: you can upload it manually

      ```
      cd ../castle-engine/doc/pasdoc/
      make clean upload
      ```

  - update FPC/Lazarus requirements if needed:
    https://castle-engine.io/supported_compilers.php

  - update CGE version of Docker `cge-stable` by
    - ssh jenkins-linux-slave.castle-engine.io
      as michalis
        update in castle-engine-cloud-build-tools/ all versions to point to 7.0-alpha.2
        ./build-local.sh

- In case of CGE and castle-model-viewer, upload them also to http://castle-engine.itch.io/ :
  Run

  ```
  # This is to make sure you have itch.io butler installed and authenticated.
  # Follow https://itch.io/docs/butler/installing.html if not yet,
  # you can actually install it using itch.io GUI app: https://itch.io/app ,
  # just "chmod +x ..." the butler binary and add it to $PATH.
  butler status castle-engine/castle-game-engine

  pack/upload_itch_io.sh
  ```

  Once `butler status castle-engine/castle-model-viewer` is good,
  - test downloading it from https://castle-engine.itch.io/castle-model-viewer (using itch.io app). TODO: right now it is https://castle-engine.itch.io/view3dscene , should be renamed.
  - write a new devlog there (copy-paste from GitHub release notes)

  Once `butler status castle-engine/castle-game-engine` is good,
  - test downloading it from https://castle-engine.itch.io/castle-game-engine (using itch.io app)
  - write a new devlog there (copy-paste from GitHub release notes)

- In case of CGE and castle-model-viewer, upload them also to https://sourceforge.net/projects/castle-engine/ files:
  Run

  ```
  pack/upload_sourceforge.sh
  ```

  Mark on SourceForge default download for Linux/Windows as latest CGE.

  Login to
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/castle-engine/

  Check this contains new files:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/castle-engine/files/castle-model-viewer/
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/castle-engine/files/castle_game_engine/

  Mark new CGE files as default for Linux/Windows.
  After a moment, Ctrl+R and "Looking for the latest version?" will show new version.

- bump versions/code afterwards, to again make nice snapshots:

    - engine: version to `x.<odd>.0` or `alpha.snapshot`

      (redo again the section above about bumping version,
      also recheck "bump version" commit that we touched the same files)

      Also revert ../castle-engine/tools/internal/pack_release/github_update_release.txt
      to snapshot.

      Also revert Jenkinsfile to do full "Build Examples" (in case you hacked it for release).

    - castle-model-viewer: version to `x.<odd>.0`

## Website updating

- Note: after large website changes it is a good idea to check
    linkchecker.sh
    validate_html.sh

- if you change some content managed inside GIT (cge-www):
  - commit and push your changes to cge-www
  - ssh-cge-sync (to update on castle-engine.io)

- make sure apidoc in https://castle-engine.io/apidoc/html/
  looks OK. It is now automatically updated by a Jenkins job,
  though if you want you can upload it manually by

    cd ~/sources/castle-engine/castle-engine/doc/pasdoc
    make upload

  You can also update https://castle-engine.io/engine_doc.php (HTML, PDF) by

    cd ~/sources/castle-engine/cge-documentation/vrml_engine_internals
    make upload

  You can also update https://castle-engine.io/compositing_shaders.php (HTML, PDF) by

    cd ~/sources/castle-engine/cge-documentation/compositing_shaders_doc
    make upload

- really large new features may cause updates of project description.
  Change project_description.txt text, and see there for a list of places
  where it's used.

  Also Lazarus wiki contains longer description of our project:
    http://wiki.freepascal.org/Castle_Game_Engine

  Also FSF wiki has descriptions:
    https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Castle_Game_Engine
    https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/View3dscene # or sthg like that

  https://castle-engine.itch.io/castle-game-engine

  https://castle-engine.itch.io/view3dscene

- http://www.web3d.org/news/submit/
  ... but it's pretty much ignored, giving up on this.
  As well as submitting to web3d.org list of progs.

- An incredibly large release may be announced on fpc-pascal and lazarus
  mailing lists, but let's not abuse it (I did it only for 4.0.0 release
  when it was justified, as a large release and focused on devs).
  These lists aren't normally for announcements from external projects.

- Watch http://planetdev.freegamedev.net/ , they aggregate our news feed.

- Submit devlog on itch.io ( https://castle-engine.itch.io/ )
  about Castle Game Engine and castle-model-viewer releases.
