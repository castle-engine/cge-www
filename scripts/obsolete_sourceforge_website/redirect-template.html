    <p>If you are not redirected automatically <a href="https://castle-engine.io/TEMPLATE">follow this link to go to the new website</a>.

    <p>Our website has moved (long time ago, in 2018!) to the new server on <a href="https://castle-engine.io/">castle-engine.io</a>. The old SourceForge website (<code>castle-engine.sourceforge.io</code>) is no longer maintained. And the redirects are done in old-fashion way, as SourceForge disabled both .htaccess and PHP support in 2025.
