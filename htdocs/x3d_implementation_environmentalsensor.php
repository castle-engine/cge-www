    <p><i>TODO</i>: <code>centerOfRotation_changed</code>
    are not generated. Rest works Ok, according to spec. Timestamps
    for isActive, enter/exitTime are not interpolated (they are simply
    timestamps when this was detected), this shouldn't be a problem in
    typical uses.</p>

  <li><p><?php echo x3d_node_link('VisibilitySensor'); ?></p>

    <p>Works fully.

    <p>For now, visibility is determined only by whether
    the box fits within a view frustum. We don't use
    occlusion query yet for this, which means that visibility is not
    as conservative as it could be. For example, box hidden behind a wall
    within frustum will still be visible (according to this sensor).
    We have occlusion query (even two approaches for it) implemented in our engine,
    so integration of <code>VisibilitySensor</code> with it will
    definitely happen one day (please report if you badly need this :).</p>

<p><i>TODO</i>: TransformSensor missing.
