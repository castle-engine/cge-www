did the whole programming and most of the 3D modelling.

<p><i>Szymon Stoma and Kaśka Zaremba</i> designed and modelled the scenario
on "The Gate" level (all models in <code>data/levels/gate/gate_parts/</code>),
modelled many 3D objects (keys, bow, quiver, arrows, ball_missile_s),
provided some sounds and a large amount of feedback.</p>

<p><i>Grzegorz Hermanowicz</i> implemented underwater "sick"
projection effect and started gravity for arrows implementation.</p>

<p><i>Michał Wojtkiewicz</i> provided the <code>levels/gate/tree</code> model.</p>

<p><i>Great thank you to everyone who contributed!</i></p>

    The base of our game.

    <p>We also used some engine tools and accompanying programs:
    <?php echo a_href_page('rayhunter', 'rayhunter'); ?>
    was used to render some items 2D images (see <code>data/items/xxx/image.png</code>),
    <a href="castle-model-viewer">Castle Model Viewer</a>
    was used to test and slightly edit 3D models,
    and to make many screenshots.

  <li><a href="http://www.planetside.co.uk/terragen/">Terragen</a>
    was used to create skies (see <code>data/skies/</code>).

  <li>Some post-processing of VRML models was done using EmacsLisp.
    See <code>data/kambi-castle-utils.el</code> and various Makefiles,
    like <code>data/levels/gate/Makefile</code>.

<p>Sounds:

    and <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> were used

  <li><a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/">Sox</a> was used
    for some batch processing of sounds.
</ul>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>While most of the data used by the game was done
by "The Castle" team (see <a href="#section_authors">above</a>),
some data was obtained from the Internet,
under various "free" licenses. Unfortunately, not 100% of them are really
FOSS compatible, but we're working on it.
See <code>castle/data/AUTHORS.txt</code> for details.

<p>The larger data collections used:

<ul>
  <li>Many textures from public domain <i>Golgotha</i> textures.
    They were hosted on various websites on the Internet,
    currently you can get (most) of them from
    <a href="http://opengameart.org/content/golgotha-textures">opengameart.org Golgotha useful textures collection</a>.
  <li>Many tileable textures with excellent quality from
    <a href="http://www.lemog.fr/lemog_textures/index.php">Lemog tileable textures</a>.
  <li>Many public domain sounds and music from
    <a href="http://www.flashkit.com/">Flash Kit</a>.
</ul>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>Inside the game I added, as a joke/experiment/tribute,
a level based on well-known
<a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/">id Software</a> game "Doom".
Level geometry and textures come from original DOOM E1M1
level, the level is just converted to VRML (and changed in many places
for my engine).</p>

<p>Thanks go to whole Id staff that produced DOOM. For a lot of technical details
how DOOM E1M1 level was done in my game, see the file
<code>data/levels/doom/e1m1/README.txt</code> in game data.
Music is taken from great <a href="http://www.sirgalahad.org/paul/doom/">"DOOM
I and II Music" as compiled by Paul Burdette</a>.

  <p><i>Legal things</i>:

  <p><b>For distro packagers</b>: remember that the Doom level and it's resources
  (i.e. most of the things inside directories <code>data/levels/doom/e1m1/</code>,
  <code>data/textures/doom/</code>, <code>data/sounds/doom/</code> and
  <code>data/skies/doom/</code>)
  are not open-source, are not
  covered by GNU GPL license, are not under my (Michalis Kamburelis)
  copyright etc. Legally, I guess that they are a heavily processed version of the
  content that was originally developed by Doom authors, and they own it.

  <p>If you want to redistribute my game as a pure open-source, you
  can simply remove these <code>doom/</code> subdirectories. The DOOM level
  will then disappear from the "New Game" menu.

  <p><b>For Id Software</b>: hopefully if any lawyer working for Id Software
  will ever spot this page, he will understand that the "Doom level" in my game is

  <ul>
    <li>Partially a joke and an experiment (how Doom level will look
      when rendered in modern technology, with free 3D and OpenGL and all).
    <li>Partially a tribute to Doom.
    <li>I include only the very first Doom level, E1M1,
      that is virtually known to every person who ever played any computer game,
      it was even released as a shareware after all.
    <li>The "Doom level" is not a main level of my game, it's just a bonus.
  </ul>

  <p>So don't sue me. Thanks :)
