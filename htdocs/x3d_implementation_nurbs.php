<p>Full support for <?php echo x3d_node_link('NurbsPatchSurface'); ?>,<br>

<p>Any &gt;= 2 value of order is allowed (X3D spec requires only 2,3,4 support).</p>

<p><?php echo x3d_node_link('NurbsTrimmedSurface'); ?>
 has only partial support: it is rendered just like <code>NurbsPatchSurface</code>,
ignoring <code>trimmingContour</code>.</p>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>Since 2022-09-01, we no longer support NURBS specifics defined in old <a href="http://www.web3d.org/documents/specifications/14772-1/V2.1/index.html"><i>VRML 97 Amendment 1</i> specification</a>. Instead you should use standard X3D NURBS nodes (even inside older VRML 2.0 / 97).

<p>Note that <i>VRML 97 Amendment 1</i> NURBS nodes are similar, but not 100% the same as their X3D counterparts. You should adjust the NURBS usage in your VRML files to X3D standard (or, even better, just upgrade your whole models to latest X3D standard). Differences:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Only X3D surfaces have <code>xClosed</code> fields. We treat TRUE value there as "possibly closed", that is &mdash; if field indicates closed, we still check if limiting points match (X3D spec suggests we should do this, as far as I understand). This means X3D models may be loaded faster &mdash; if xClosed = FALSE, we do not even check if limiting points match.</p></li>

  <li><p>Only VRML 97 surfaces have <code>ccw</code> field.</p></li>

  <li><p>VRML 97 versions specify <code>coord</code> as direct <code>MFVec3f</code> field, while X3D versions specify <code>coord</code> as <code>SFNode</code> (containing <code>Coordinate</code> or similar node).</p></li>

  <li><p>VRML 97 <code>NurbsPositionInterpolator</code> has different field names (keyValue, keyWeight, following interpolator conventions) than X3D <code>NurbsPositionInterpolator</code> (controlPoint, weight, following nurbs conventions).</p></li>

  <li><p>VRML 97 <code>NurbsPositionInterpolator</code> has different default value for order (4) than X3D version (3). Beware of this when converting from VRML 97 to X3D.</p></li>

  <li><p>In VRML 97, <code>knot</code> and <code>weight</code> data is <code>MFFloat</code>, single-precision. In X3D, it's <code>MFDouble</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>Note that in VRML and X3D, NURBS control points are expressed in
homogeneous coordinates. That is, the control point is actually
a 4D vector <code>(x, y, z, weight)</code>, which means that it's actual 3D position
is <code>(x/weight, y/weight, z/weight)</code>.</p>

<p>This may be a little confusing, if you're used to normal NURBS
equation definition like from <a href="http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~shene/COURSES/cs3621/NOTES/spline/NURBS/NURBS-def.html">here</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline">at Wikipedia</a>.
Instead of usual equation:</p>

<pre>P(u) = (sum of basis * control point * weight) / (sum of basis * weight)</pre>

<p>VRML/X3D uses a simpler equation:</p>

<pre>P(u) = (sum of basis * control point) / (sum of basis * weight)</pre>

<p>That is, <i>"X3D control point"</i> (as specified in VRML/X3D file) is assumed
to be already multiplied by weight.</p>

<p>If you want to intuitively pull the curve toward the control point,
you should</p>

<ol>
  <li>Calculate <i>"normal control point"</i> (3D, not in homogeneous coordinates)
    as <i>"X3D control point / weight"</i>.</li>
  <li>Increase the weight (to pull the curve toward <i>"normal control point"</i>),
    or decrease (to push the curve away from it).</li>
  <li>Calculate new <i>"X3D control point"</i> as
    <i>"normal control point * new weight"</i>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, if you just want to increase the weight 2 times,
then the corresponding control point should also be multiplied * 2,
to make things behave intuitive.</p>

<p>In particular, when writing an exporter from normal 3D modeling programs,
like <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, note that you have
to multiply Blender control points * Blender weights to get correct
X3D control points. When you use <a href="http://wdune.ourproject.org/">White Dune</a>,
a NURBS 3D modeler especially suited for working with VRML/X3D,
this non-intuitive behavior is somewhat hidden (the <a href="http://129.69.35.12/dune/docs/usage_docs/dune_en.html#nurbsbasics">curve "handles"</a>
you see in White Dune are actually <i>"X3D control points / divided by weight"</i>).</p>

<p>Our behavior is compatible with other X3D browsers/editors
(at least <a href="http://wdune.ourproject.org/">White Dune</a>,
Octaga, InstantPlayer, BitManagement).
