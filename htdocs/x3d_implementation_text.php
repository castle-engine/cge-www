<p>For complete demos and tests of these features,

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<ul>
  <li><p><?php echo x3d_node_link('Text'); ?>

    <p>Text displayed in a scene.
    The text may be multi-line, it can be textured, displayed with
    various size, justification, and font styles.
    While the text is a flat object, it can be rotated in 3D scene,
    like any other plane in 3D.

    <p>The <code>Text</code> is also "clickable" within
    <code>Anchor</code> and <code>TouchSensor</code> nodes.
    A whole line of text is just a simple quad, when considered for collision
    detection.
    <!--
    Although I didn't find any mention in the specifications that I should
    do this, many VRML models seem to assume this.
    We make an ultra-simple triangulation of the text
    (just taking 2 triangles to cover whole text, you don't want
    to produce real triangles for text node, as text node would have
    a lot of triangles!).<br/>
    <i>TODO</i>: unfortunately, for now these triangles also participate
    in collision detection, while spec says that text shouldn't collide.
    -->

  <li><p><?php echo x3d_node_link('FontStyle'); ?>

    <p>Style of the font used by the <code>Text</code> node.
</ul>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>Most important properties
(size, spacing, justify (horizontal and vertical),
family, style) are supported.

<p><i>TODO</i>: Properties not implemented yet:

<ul>
  <li><p>FontStyle: From section
    <i>6.22.3 Direction and justification</i>:
    fields horizontal, leftToRight, topToBottom
    (we always behave like they had default values,
    TRUE, TRUE, TRUE). From section <i>6.22.4 Language</i>:
    language field is ignored.

  <li><p><code>Text</code>: length, maxExtent are
    ignored (and handled like they had
    default values, which means that the text is not stretched).
</ul>
