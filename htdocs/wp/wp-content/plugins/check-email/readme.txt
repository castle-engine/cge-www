- Test email sending - if youâ€™re not sure whether WordPress is sending emails, you can use this plugin to find out.

- Viewing logged emails - they can be viewed from the admin interface, as they are stored in a separate table. You get the option to filter them based on subject, email, date, etc.
- Deleting logged emails - you can delete them by going to the admin interface. You can either delete them in bulk or  selectively - by date, email, or subject. 
- Ability to change the "mail from" email address, "mail from name" and override default email WordPress addresses.
