<p><i>CastleScript</i> is a language to calculate expressions and (simple) scripts,
available in <i>Castle Game Engine</i>.

<p>It's an integral part of our engine, without the need for any external libraries.

<p>The language can process various types:

<ul>
  <li>numbers,
  <li>booleans,
  <li>strings,
  <li>vectors,
  <li>matrices,
  <li>images.
  <li>Also arrays of all these things are supported.
</ul>

<p>There are many built-in functions and operators, heavily overloaded
for all types where they apply. For example, you can simply add numbers,
vectors, matrices or strings like <code>X + Y</code>.

<p>Language implementation is flexible,
you can extend it easily (from Pascal) to add new data-types and functions.
<!--
The language is completely safe (that is, there's no possibility for
malicious script author to do something harmful)
simply because the language is a closed data-processing language
(the only I/O routines are
<?php func_ref('image_load', 'image_load(url)'); ?> and
<?php func_ref('writeln', 'writeln(string)'); ?>, and they
expose functionality that is possible anyway with
pure non-scripted X3D).
--></p>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>The language can be used to <b>evaluate mathematical expressions</b>
in your game at runtime. This has many uses, in particular game designers can get
greater control over specifying various parameters of your game.
Instead of hardcoding things like this:

<?php echo xml_full_highlight('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game_configuration>
  <player_life value="100" />
  <spawn dragons_per_minute="3" />
</game_configuration>'); ?>

<p>you can use <i>CastleScript</i> and allow to write expressions like this:

<?php echo xml_full_highlight('<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<game_configuration>
  <!-- calculate expression -->
  <player_life value="10 * 10" />
  <!-- calculate expression using "current_difficulty" variable defined by Pascal -->
  <spawn dragons_per_minute="2 * current_difficulty" />
</game_configuration>'); ?>

<p>The Pascal API is quite simple, see the
<?php echo cgeRef('CastleScriptParser', 'CastleScriptParser'); ?> unit.
Use trivial
<?php echo cgeRef('ParseConstantFloatExpression', 'ParseConstantFloatExpression'); ?>
 as a replacement for <code>StrToFloat</code> to calculate expressions using constants and all our functions and operators.
Use
<?php echo cgeRef('ParseFloatExpression', 'ParseFloatExpression'); ?>
 to calculate an expresion with possible CastleScript variables.
You can calculate other types, e.g. strings by
<?php echo cgeRef('ParseStringExpression', 'ParseStringExpression'); ?>.
 To read float expression from XML you can helpers from
<?php echo cgeRef('CastleScriptXML', 'CastleScriptXML'); ?> unit,
 so you can write <code>MyDomElement.GetFloatExpression('value')</code>.

<p>The syntax to calculate mathematical expressions is used throughout our engine,
for example <?php echo a_href_page('glplotter', 'glplotter'); ?>
 uses this syntax to define function expressions.</p>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>You can use <i>CastleScript</i> in X3D <code>Script</code> nodes.

<p>The examples are in <a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/demo-models">our demo models</a>,
see there in <a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/demo-models/tree/master/castle_script">castle_script subdirectory</a>.

<p>URLs in <code>Script</code> node starting with <code>castlescript:</code>
are understood to contain program in CastleScript language.
URLs to external files with extension <code>.castlescript</code> point
to whole files in CastleScript language.
(Deprecated: also <code>kambiscript:</code> as a protocol and
<code>.kambiscript</code> as an extension are recognized.) Like this:</p>

<?php echo vrmlx3d_highlight(
'Script {
  inputOnly SFFloat foo
  outputOnly SFFloat foo_plus_one

  url "castlescript:
       function foo(value, timestamp)
         foo_plus_one := value + 1
      "
}

Script {
  url "my_script.castlescript"
}'); ?>

<p>Note that <i>CastleScript</i> is a very simple scripting language,
with some features inspired by many other languages, and some decisions just
dictated by the desire to keep implemetation simple.
For example <code>if</code>, <code>while</code> and such have somewhat ugly syntax,
as they are done using built-in functions like
<?php func_ref('if', 'if(condition, then_code, else_code)'); ?>.
<i>This language doesn't try to compete with larger scripting languages</i>
(like <i>ECMAScript</i>, commonly used in X3D scripting).
It's not suitable for larger programs
(for starters, you cannot define your own types).<!-- ; you also cannot
currently call user-defined functions (you can only call built-in functions;
user-defined functions are only automatically called when X3D Script
receives an event); also you cannot declare your own local variables
(but you can use X3D Script initializeOnly fields for this purpose)-->
Also it's specific to our engine, and probably always will be.

<p>We do not plan to extend the <i>CastleScript</i> in the direction of <i>"general scripting language"</i>
for now. We feel there are already a lot of other scripting languaes,
available also from Pascal applications, that serve a purpose <i>"scripting language
for larger, non-trivial applications"</i> better.

<!--
And do note that our engine doesn't support (yet) ECMAScript for X3D scripting
at all, so this is the only way to do scripting for now (without
writing and compiling any Pascal code).
-->

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>Some examples of simple mathematical expressions for glplotter:</p>

<pre>
  sin(x) ^ 10
  2 * (cos(ln(x)) - 1)
  sin(x) &gt; cos(x)
  or( sin(x) &gt; cos(x), sin(x) &gt; 0 )
</pre>

<p>Some example of simple program for X3D script node:</p>

<?php echo vrmlx3d_highlight(
'Script {
  # Let\'s assume some TouchSensor.touchTime is routed here.
  # When user clicks on this touch sensor, you want to close the door
  # if they are open, or open them if they are closed.
  inputOnly SFTime touch_time

  initializeOnly SFBool open FALSE

  # Let\'s assume this is routed to some TimeSensor.set_startTime
  # that starts closing animation.
  outputOnly SFTime close_time

  # Let\'s assume this is routed to some TimeSensor.set_startTime
  # that starts opening animation.
  outputOnly SFTime open_time

  url "castlescript:
       function touch_time(value, timestamp)
         if (open,
             close_time := timestamp,
             open_time := timestamp);
         open := not(open)
      "
}'); ?>

<p>Example script behavior above could also be done by combining
<code>BooleanToggle</code>, <code>BooleanFilter</code>, <code>TimeTrigger</code>
X3D nodes.
But script is already simpler and shorter, and allows you to trivially
add other interesting things.</p>

<?php echo vrmlx3d_highlight(
'# Simple converter from SFString to MFString using built-in <?php func_ref(\'array\', \'array\'); ?> function.
Script {
  inputOnly SFString input
  outputOnly MFString output
    url "castlescript:
         function input(value, timestamp)
           output := array(value)
        "
}'); ?>

<p>Some larger examples:
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/demo-models/blob/master/castle_script/ball_game.x3dv">ball_game.x3dv</a>
    &mdash; a small X3D game, with whole game logic implemented in CastleScript
    (key handling by KeySensor node). Can be played in any X3D browser
    supporting CastleScript, like <a href="castle-model-viewer">Castle Model Viewer</a>
    or any of the example X3D browser components in engine sources.

  <li><p><a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/demo-models/blob/master/castle_script/edit_texture.x3dv">edit_texture.x3dv</a>
    &mdash; a toy image editor. Again, it's a pure X3D file (you can
    open it and use with any X3D browser supporting CastleScript).
    Uses CastleScript to implement various simple image editing
    functions. It's a toy, not to be treated as a serious image editor
    of course (there is no possibility to save created image for starter,
    since CastleScript doesn't allow to save files from X3D for safety reasons.)
    But it shows that even image processing is quite easy with CastleScript.

  <li><p><a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/demo-models/blob/master/castle_script/particles.x3dv">particles.x3dv</a>
    &mdash; a simple particle engine. Whole particles animation,
    logic (randomization, speed, gravity) is implemented in CastleScript.
    "Particles" are rendered as points and lines (<code>PointSet</code>,
    <code>IndexedLineSet</code>).
</ul>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p><i>Syntax is free-form</i>, the only use of whitespace (including newlines,
or any indentation) is to separate tokens when needed (for example, between
two identifiers).</p>

<p><i>Comments</i> are within curly braces: <code>{ this is a comment }</code>
(Pascal-like).</p>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p><i>Types</i> are never explicitly declared, and are checked
at runtime. Four core types are available:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p><i>Integers.</i>
    Syntax of integer constants is obvious,
    like <code>123</code>. Built-in function
    <?php func_ref('int', 'int(...)'); ?> allows
    you to convert other core types into integer.</p>

    <p>We use 64-bit signed integers (although for X3D long/int32
    fields, they will have to fit within 32-bit.)</p>

    <p>Specifically for comfortable processing of
    <a href="http://www.web3d.org/documents/specifications/19775-1/V3.3/Part01/components/keyboard.html#KeySensor">X3D
    KeySensor node</a> events <code>actionKeyPress/Release</code>
    you have 20 key constants available: <code>ACTION_KEY_F1</code>,
    ... <code>ACTION_KEY_F12</code>, <code>ACTION_KEY_HOME</code>, etc.
    (see KeySensor specification for full list).</p></li>

  <li><p><i>Floats.</i> Syntax of float constants
    is also obvious, like <code>3.1415</code>. You have
    constants <code>pi</code> and <code>enat</code> (Euler's number).
    Built-in function
    <?php func_ref('float', 'float(...)'); ?> allows
    you to convert other core types into float.</p>

    <p>Precision: uses the best floating-point type precision on given
    platform, which means at least Double, and on many platforms
    Extended.</p></li>

  <li><p><i>Booleans.</i> Two obvious constants are available, <code>false</code>
    and <code>true</code> (case is ignored, as usual in CastleScript,
    so you can also write uppercase
    <code>FALSE</code> or <code>TRUE</code> like in classic encoding).
    Built-in function
    <?php func_ref('bool', 'bool(...)'); ?> allows
    you to convert other core types into boolean.</p></li>

  <li><p><i>Strings.</i> Syntax of constants is Pascalish (in apostrophes, and two
    consecutive apostrophes inside mean that you want a single literal
    apostrophe character). For example <code>'He said "It''s mine."'</code>.
    Apostrophe was chosen not only because, y'know, it's Pascalish :),
    but also because it makes embedding CastleScript code within
    X3D string easier (no need to escape quotes by backslashes).
    You can make actual newlines within the string, like in X3D.
    For example:
<?php echo vrmlx3d_highlight(
'Script {
  # Let\'s assume some TouchSensor.touchTime is routed here.
  inputOnly SFTime touch_time
  outputOnly MFString text

  url "castlescript:
       function touch_time(value, timestamp)
         text := array(
           \'First string of text clicked on \' + string(value),
           \'Second string of text.
Still second string of text.
Simply make a newline in the string literal to get a newline inside the string.\'
         )
      "
}'); ?>

    <p>Built-in function
    <?php func_ref('string', 'string(...)'); ?> allows
    you to convert other core types into string.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The one and only implicit type conversion (promotion) of types is from
integer to float (for example, <code>my_float := 44</code> works,
you don't have to write <code>my_float := 44.0</code>).
In particular, note that <i>boolean type is not interchangeable
with integer</i> like in C. If you want to convert between boolean and integer,
you have to convert explicitly by <code>bool(my_int)</code> or <code>int(my_bool)</code>,
like in Pascal. The only exception is when using CastleScript solely for
mathematical expressions (like in <?php echo a_href_page(
'glplotter',
'glplotter'); ?>, internally using <code>ParseFloatExpression</code>
function): in this case, result is always implicitly converted to float,
like it would be embedded within <code>float(...)</code> call.
</p>

<p>When using CastleScript inside X3D scripts, internally you have
all the X3D field types available (which means that
vec2f, vec3f, vec4f, matrix, image and others are included).
There is no special syntax for reading/writing other types, instead
you have many functions to construct and set them.
For example for vec3f type you have "constructor"
<?php func_ref('vector', 'vector(x, y, z)'); ?> ,
reader for particular component <?php func_ref('vector_get', 'vector_get(vector, index)'); ?>,
and setter for particular component <?php func_ref('vector_set', 'vector_set(vector, index, component_value)'); ?>.
Even images have functions to create and modify them, which means
that you can use CastleScript to perform basic image creation and processing.</p>

<p>Also array types are internally available, for X3D multiple-value
(MFXxx) types. Again no special syntax is available (sorry, no bracket parenthesis),
but there are functions to construct array
<?php func_ref('array', 'array(item1, item2, ...)'); ?>,
read component <?php func_ref('array_get', 'array_get(array, index)'); ?> and
set component <?php func_ref('array_set', 'array_set(array, index, component_value)'); ?>.

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p><i>Program</i> is just a set of functions. The engine will take care
to call function <code>xxx</code> when input event of the same name will arrive.</p>

<p><i>Expressions and instructions</i> are the same thing within
the language. For example, "assignment" is an instruction, since
it causes calculation of the right operand and assigning it to the left
operand, but it's also an "expression", since it returns the value
(the assigned value).
So "chained" assignment, like in C, is possible (although
usually discouraged, to not obfuscate the code): <code>a := b := x + y</code> works.
In the rest of this description, terms "instruction" and "expression"
mean exactly the same thing.</p>

<p><i>Function</i> starts from the <code>function</code> keyword,
then function name (identifier),
then list of 0 or more parameters (identifiers separated by commas),
always within parenthesis. For functions within X3D Script nodes:
<code>initialize</code> and <code>shutdown</code> must take exactly
one parameter (timestamp of the event: SFTime), functions called
by incoming events must take exactly two parameters (value send to the event,
and timestamp: SFTime).</p>

<p>Function body is just a sequence of expressions separated by
semicolon. Formally, function body is actually a single expression,
but we have a semicolon operator: <code>A;B</code> means "calculate A,
ignore result, then calculate and return result of B".
For now, result of functions body is ignored (so all our functions
are in fact <i>procedures</i>).
Semicolon works like a delimiter (not a terminator,
so it's used only between instructions).</p>

<p>Note that the way semicolon and expressions are defined means
that we don't need any special syntax for compound instruction
(like <code>begin end</code> in Pascal or
<code>{ }</code> in C). Instead, normal parenthesis may be
used if necessary to group instructions.</p>

<p>An <i>assignment instruction</i> is an operand, followed by
the assignment operator <code>:=</code> (Pascal-like),
followed by an expression to calculate value to assign.

<p>For X3D scripts, you are allowed to assign to output events
and to fields (exposed or not). Events sending behavior follows ECMAScript
standard:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Assigning value to initializeOnly (not exposed) field is simple, it just
    assigns value to this field. You can use initializeOnly fields as
    "variables" available for your scripts (since CastleScript doesn't
    allow you to declare or use new variables within the program, for now).
    </p></li>

  <li><p>Assigning value to output event results in sending this event,
    assigning to exposed field results in sending this to input event of this field.

    <p>Following ECMAScript standard, events are not send immediately
    (right at the assignment), instead they are stacked and send
    when script function finished execution. When you assigned
    multiple values for the same field/event, only the last one is send.
    In case of multiple-value fields, the combined end value is send.
    For example, assuming <code>output</code> is an <code>outputOnly</code>
    event of MFFloat type:

<pre>
function foo(value, timestamp)
  output := array(0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0);
  array_set(output, 1, 666.0);
  array_set(output, 2, 44.0)
</pre>

    <p>The example above will send one <code>output</code> event with value
    <code>(0.0, 666.0, 44.0, 3.0)</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Right side of the assignment instruction is the value to calculate
and assign. In short, a normal mathematical expression is allowed there,
just like you seen in all programming languages. We have multiplicative
operators (<code>/, *, ^, %</code>),
we have additive operators (<code>+, -</code>) with lower
priority, we have comparison operators
(<code>&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, = or &lt;&gt;</code>) with even lower
priority. We have all standard math
functions. Built-in functions and operators are overloaded
for all suitable types. Section below gives a full list of operators
and functions.</p>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<ul>
  <li><p><?php func('int', 'int(...)'); ?> converts a "core" type
    to an integer.</p>

    <p>Float is converted to int by discarding it's fractional
    part (like in C; for positive numbers, this is like <code>floor</code>, for negative
    this is like <code>ceil</code>).
    There are also functions <?php func('floor', 'floor'); ?>, <?php func('ceil', 'ceil'); ?> and
    <?php func('round', 'round'); ?> that convert float to an integer with other rounding
    modes.</p>

    <p>Bool is converted to 0 (false) or 1 (true).
    Yes, unlike most languages that usually
    don't guarantee "true" value (saying "true" is anything &lt;&gt; 0),
    CastleScript actually guarantees that "true" will result in 1.
    This is sometimes useful in smart mathematical expressions
    (like <code>my_int := 1 - int(my_bool)</code>).</p>

    <p>String is converted to int by, well,
    converting string to integer using standard decimal notation
    (<code>int('123') = 123</code>).</p></li>

  <li><p><?php func('float', 'float(...)'); ?> converts a "core" type
    to a float.</p>

    <p>Integer is converted obviously. Actually it's never needed to
    explicitly cast integer to float, this conversion happens automatically,
    like in most programming languages.</p>

    <p>Bool is converted to 0.0 (false) or 1.0 (true).</p>

    <p>String is converted to float by parsing number from string,
    like <code>float('3.14') = 3.14</code>.</p></li>

  <li><p><?php func('bool', 'bool(...)'); ?> converts a "core" type
    to a boolean.</p>

    <p>Integers and floats are converted to "false" if equal zero, "true"
    otherwise.</p>

    <p>Strings are converted to booleans recognizing 'false' and 'true'
    strings (and making errors in other cases).</p></li>

  <li><p><?php func('string', 'string(...)'); ?> converts a "core" type
    to a string.</p>

    <p>Not much to write here, numbers (integers and floats) are converted
    to normal notation and boolean is converted to 'false' or 'true'.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All four basic conversion functions accept also variables that already
have the necessary type. For example, converting float to float is a valid
(and harmless) operation.</p>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p><?php func('if', 'if(condition, then_code, else_code)'); ?> is our
conditional instruction. <code>condition</code> is first calculated, must be a boolean
value. If it's true, then <code>then_code</code> is executed and returned as
"if" value. Otherwise, <code>else_code</code> is executed and returned as
"if" value. You may note that (because of CastleScript unification of
"instruction" and "expression" terms) this can be used in both
functional and imperative form. That is, all below are valid:</p>

<pre>
  { imperative form }
  if(x &gt; 3, y := 'yes', y := 'no');

  { functional form, equivalent to above, looks more elegant in this case }
  y := if(x &gt; 3, 'yes', 'no');

  { actually, even this is possible if you need it: }
  y_copy := if(x &gt; 3, y := 'yes', y:= 'no');
</pre>

<p><?php func('when', 'when(condition, then_code)'); ?> is
a conditional instruction without the "else" clause.
It's equivalent to <code>if(condition, then_code, false)</code>, so it simply
returns <code>false</code> when condition is not satisfied.
(This is considered a good thing that the normal <code>if</code>
<i>requires</i> the else clause; this way we avoid trivial errors
when programmer forgets to write <code>else</code> clause; similar
<code>when</code> expression may be found e.g. in Lisp and <a href="http://nemerle.org/">Nemerle</a>.)
</p>

<p><?php func('while', 'while(condition, loop_code)'); ?> performs
a while loop. Calculate <code>condition</code> (must yield a boolean value),
if true then execute <code>loop_code</code> and again calculate <code>condition</code>,
if it's still true then execute <code>loop_code</code> again, ... you get the idea.</p>

<p><?php func('for', 'for(counter, begin_value, end_value, loop_code)'); ?> performs
a for loop. <code>counter</code> must be an assignable integer variable
(note that for now you cannot declare new variables for CastleScript;
you usually need to overuse <code>initializeOnly</code> field of X3D script
node for this). <code>begin_value</code>, <code>end_value</code> must also
be integer values, will be calculated once at the beginning of the loop.
We will assign to <code>counter</code> variable integer values
from <code>begin_value</code> to <code>end_value</code>, and for each
counter value we will execute <code>loop_code</code>.
It's undefined what happens when <code>loop_code</code> changes directly the
<code>counter</code> value.</p>

<p><code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops return
the value of last executed <code>loop_code</code>,
or <code>false</code> if <code>loop_code</code> did not get executed even once.</p>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>Self-explanatory math functions are listed below.
They all take a float type, and return a float type unless otherwise noted:</p>

<ul>
  <li><?php func('sin', 'sin'); ?>,
      <?php func('cos', 'cos'); ?>,
      <?php func('tan', 'tan'); ?>,
      <?php func('cotan', 'cotan'); ?>
  <li><?php func('arcsin', 'arcsin'); ?>,
      <?php func('arccos', 'arccos'); ?>,
      <?php func('arctan', 'arctan'); ?>,
      <?php func('arccotan', 'arccotan'); ?>
  <li><?php func('sinh', 'sinh'); ?>,
      <?php func('cosh', 'cosh'); ?>,
      <?php func('tanh', 'tanh'); ?>,
      <?php func('cotanh', 'cotanh'); ?>
  <li><?php func('log2', 'log2'); ?> (same as <code>log(2, x)</code>),
      <?php func('ln', 'ln'); ?>,
      <?php func('log', 'log'); ?>,
      <?php func('power2', 'power2'); ?> (same as <code>power(2, x) = 2^x</code>),
      <?php func('exp', 'exp'); ?> (same as <code>power(enat, x) = enat^x</code>),
      <?php func('power', 'power'); ?>,
      <?php func('sqr', 'sqr'); ?>,
      <?php func('sqrt', 'sqrt'); ?><br>
  <li><?php func('sgn', 'sgn'); ?> (returns integer), <?php func('abs', 'abs'); ?>
  <li><?php func('max', 'max'); ?>, <?php func('min', 'min'); ?>
    (any number of arguments &gt;= 1 allowed; works on either floats or ints)
  <li><?php func('lerp', 'lerp(fraction, a, b)'); ?>
</ul>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p><?php func('random', 'random()'); ?> returns a random float number
within 0...1 range (0 included, 1 excluded).</p>

<p><?php func('random', 'random(int)'); ?> returns a random integer number
strictly less than <code>int</code> and &gt;= 0.
(<code>int</code> argument must be &gt; 0).</p>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>Basic boolean operations:
<?php func('or', 'or(bool1, bool2...)'); ?>,
<?php func('and', 'and(bool1, bool2...)'); ?> (any number of arguments
&gt;= 1), <?php func('not', 'not(bool1)'); ?>.</p>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>You can add (concatenate) and compare (case-sensitive) strings
by normal operators. Converting other
core types (numbers, booleans) to string may be done by the
<?php func_ref('string', 'string(...)'); ?> function.

<p><?php func('writeln', 'writeln(my_string)'); ?> outputs a string.
How exactly it is displayed depends on the application:
normal 3D browsers (like <a href="castle-model-viewer">Castle Model Viewer</a>)
display it on the console (standard error output, if <code>--debug-log</code> is used),
games (like <?php echo a_href_page('The Castle', 'castle'); ?>)
display it as in-game notification.
As a developer, you can configure how this is handled,
see <code>OnScriptMessage</code> in <code>CastleScript</code> unit.
By default, it results in <code>CastleLog.WritelnLog</code>, see
the <a href="log">manual about logging</a>.</p>

<p>Most array functions can also treat the string as an array of characters.
We do not have a special type for a "character" &mdash; we just use a string with length 1.
You can get / set the length of the string with
<?php func_ref('array_get_count', 'array_get_count(string)'); ?> /
<?php func_ref('array_set_count', 'array_set_count(string, count)'); ?>.
And you can get / set a specific character of the string with
<?php func_ref('array_get_count', 'array_get(string, index)'); ?> /
<?php func_ref('array_set_count', 'array_set(string, index, character)'); ?>.
Indexes for characters inside string are zero-based, like for all arrays
in CastleScript.</p>

<p><?php func('character_from_code', 'character_from_code(int)'); ?> converts integer
character code to a 1-letter string with this character.
<i>Only the ASCII character codes are guaranteed to work for now.</i>
Although we support Unicode character set (encoded as UTF-8 in Pascal AnsiString)
throughout the engine, but some CastleScript functions were not adjusted to it yet
(report if you need it).

<p><?php func('shortcut', 'shortcut(name)'); ?> returns a nice string describing the named key/mouse shortcut
in the game. It's useful if you want to show a message describing some
shortcut, for example <code>writeln('Hint: you can open this door using the ' +
shortcut('interact'))</code>. Depending on user current key definitions,
we will show something like <i>Hint: you can open this door using the key "e"</i>
or <i>Hint: you can open this door using the mouse "left"</i>.
See <code>CastleInputs</code> for available shortcut names, additionally
games may define their own key shortcuts by creating new <code>TInputConfiguration</code>
instances.</p>

<p><?php func('coalesce', 'coalesce(expression, ...)'); ?> returns the first string that is not empty.
<ul>
  <li><p>It takes from 1 to any number of arguments. The arguments are evaluated in order, until one of them returns a string that is not empty (the remaining arguments are not evaluated at all), or we reach the last argument.

  <li><p>That is, the only case when this function can return an empty string, is if the last argument is an empty string.

  <li><p>This function is handy to provide a "fallback" or "default" value for some variables. E.g. you can write <code>coalesce(my_variable, 'default value')</code>.
</ul>

<p>A lot of string functions are trivial to add
&mdash; report if you need some particular function.

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p><?php func('array', 'array(item1, item2, ...)'); ?>
 constructs an array. At least one argument is required.
All arguments must have the same type (X3D multiple-value fields
can't have mixed types).</p>

<p>Note that parameter-less <code>array()</code> call is not allowed,
because we wouldn't know then the resulting type (is it an
empty array of floats? empty array of integers? etc.)
Don't worry, you can use <code>array_set_count(my_array, 0)</code> for making
array empty.</p>

<p>Note that floating-point values in arrays are stored only with single-
or double- precision. This contrasts with singleton values, which are always stored
in the best precision possible. Having explicit single-
or double- precision arrays is better for storage and allows faster
copying between X3D fields. Normal <code>array</code> with float parameters will create
an array of single-precision values (that is, X3D <code>MFFloat</code>).
You have to call <?php func('array_d', 'array_d'); ?> to request double-precision storage
(suitable for X3D <code>MFDouble</code> or <code>MFTime</code>).</p>

<p><?php func('array_get_count', 'array_get_count(my_array)'); ?> and
<?php func('array_set_count', 'array_set_count(my_array, new_count)'); ?> get and set array count.
When you grow array, newly added items have undefined values.
When you shrink array, excessive values are discarded.</p>

<p><?php echo func('array_get', 'array_get(my_array, index)'); ?>
 gets an item from array on given index. In "normal" programming languages,
implemented by less lazy programmers, this is written as <code>my_array[index]</code> :)
Analogous
<?php echo func('array_set', 'array_set(my_array, index, component_value)'); ?>
 sets a value of item in an array.
In "normal" programming languages you would write <code>my_array[index] := component_value</code>.

<p><code>array_set</code> and <code>array_set_count</code> also return the new array
(that is, they return the new value of their 1st argument),
this may be comfortable sometimes.</p>

<p>You can glue (concatenate) two or more arrays by the "+" operator.</p>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<?php
echo castle_thumbs(array(
  array('filename' => 'glplotter_screen_hermite_tense.png', 'titlealt' => 'hermine_tense_spline example'),
  array('filename' => 'glplotter_screen_hermite_tense_scaled.png', 'titlealt' => 'hermine_tense_spline example, scaled by x'),
));
?>

<p>An array can be used to define a curve which can then be evaluated.
This is cool for designing curves, for example for movement or some game balance!
Since the curve is a function, you can easily combine it with other
functions.

<p>For example this is a simple "three increasing bumps" function:

<pre>
hermite_tense_spline(x, true,
  array(0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0),
  array(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 4.0, 0.0))
</pre>

<p>You can easily scale it up, as the x increases:

<pre>
(1 + x * 0.1) *
hermite_tense_spline(x, true,
  array(0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0),
  array(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 4.0, 0.0))
</pre>

<p>The available curves functions are:

<ul>
  <li><?php echo func('catmull_rom_spline',     'catmull_rom_spline(x: <span class="type">float</span>, loop: <span class="type">boolean</span>, arguments: <span class="type">array of float</span>, values: <span class="type">array of float</span>): returns <span class="type">float</span>'); ?>
  <li><?php echo func('hermite_spline',             'hermite_spline(x: <span class="type">float</span>, loop: <span class="type">boolean</span>, arguments: <span class="type">array of float</span>, values: <span class="type">array of float</span>, tangents: <span class="type">array of float</span>): returns <span class="type">float</span>'); ?>
  <li><?php echo func('hermite_tense_spline', 'hermite_tense_spline(x: <span class="type">float</span>, loop: <span class="type">boolean</span>, arguments: <span class="type">array of float</span>, values: <span class="type">array of float</span>): returns <span class="type">float</span>'); ?>
</ul>

<p><!--The parameters should be self-explanatory.--> Try these functions with
latest <?php echo a_href_page('glplotter', 'glplotter'); ?> to see
the curves shapes when rendered.

documentation

and Catmull-Rom splines</a>.

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p><?php func('vector', 'vector(x, y), vector(x, y, z), vector(x, y, z, w)'); ?>
 create a single-precision vectors (called <code>SFVec2f</code>,
<code>SFVec3f</code>, <code>SFVec4f</code> in X3D).
Suffix <code>_d</code> means that you want double-precision vectors:
<?php func('vector_d', 'vector_d(x, y), vector_d(x, y, z), vector_d(x, y, z, w)'); ?>.</p>

<p><?php echo func('vector_get', 'vector_get(my_vec, index)'); ?>
 gets vector component. Allowed index values obviously depend on vector size,
for example on <code>SFVec3f</code> you can use index 0, 1, 2.
<?php echo func('vector_set', 'vector_set(my_vec, index, component_value)'); ?>
 sets given vector component (and returns new vector, for comfort).</p>

<p><?php func('vector_get_count', 'vector_get_count(my_vec)'); ?> is available,
for analogy with <code>array_get_count</code>. Vector has a fixed number
of components, so there is no <code>vector_set_count</code>.
</p>

<p>Standard vector math utilities are available:
<?php func('vector_length(v)', 'vector_length(v)'); ?>, <?php func('vector_sqr_length(v)', 'vector_sqr_length(v)'); ?>,
<?php func('vector_dot(v1,v2)', 'vector_dot(v1, v2)'); ?>  (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">vector dot product in wikipedia</a>),
<?php func('vector_cross(v1,v2)', 'vector_cross(v1, v2)'); ?> (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product">vector cross product in wikipedia</a>,
only on 3-component vectors).
<?php func('max', 'max(vector1, vector2)'); ?>,
<?php func('min', 'min(vector1, vector2)'); ?>
 also work (make max/min on corresponding vector components).

<p>You can also add, subtract, multiply by scalar, divide by scalar,
compare vectors by normal operators.
Linear interpolation by <?php func('lerp', 'lerp(fraction, vector1, vector2)'); ?>
 on vectors also works.</p>

<p>Color functions: <?php func('grayscale', 'grayscale(v)'); ?>
 takes a vec3f, treats it
as RGB color, and converts it to a single float &mdash; color intensity
(calculated much like an average of vector components, but taking into
account human eye sensitivity).

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>Rotations (X3D <code>SFRotation</code>, or an element of
<code>MFRotation</code> array) are, in CastleScript, just 4-value single-precision
vectors. First three scalars are rotation axis (should be always normalized,
X3D require this), 4th item is the rotation angle (in radians).
So you can operate on rotations from CastleScript using all normal functions
on vectors.</p>

<p>Some functions specially suitable for rotations are also available:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><?php func('orientation_from_direction_up', 'orientation_from_direction_up(dir, up)'); ?>
    converts a direction and up 3D vectors into an orientation.
    This is a rotation that transforms default direction (0, 0, -1)
    and default up (0, 1, 0) into your desired <code>direction</code> and <code>up</code> vectors.
    This is suitable for example for calculating
    X3D <code>Viewpoint.orientation</code>.</p>

    <p>Given here direction and up vectors do not have to be normalized
    (they only must not be zero). They also do not have to be orthogonal
    (we will internally fix the up vector, if needed, to be orthogonal
    to direction).</p>

  <li><p><?php func('rotate', 'rotate(rotation, point)'); ?>
    rotates given 3D <code>point</code>. <code>rotation</code> parameter contains
    an axis (first three components) and an angle in radians (last component),
    so it's compatible with X3D <code>SFRotation</code>.</p>

  <li><p><?php func('orientation_to_direction', 'orientation_to_direction(rotation)'); ?>
    determines direction vector back from an orientation,
    inverting what <?php func_ref('orientation_from_direction_up', 'orientation_from_direction_up'); ?> did.
    Similarly <?php func('orientation_to_up', 'orientation_to_up(rotation)'); ?>.
    Resulting direction and up vectors are always normalized.</p>

    <p>These functions are equivalent to using <code>rotate(rotation, (0, 0, -1))</code>
    (for <code>orientation_to_direction</code>) and <code>rotate(rotation, (0, 1, 0))</code>
    (for <code>orientation_to_up</code>).</p></li>

  <li><p><?php func('slerp', 'slerp(value, rotation1, rotation2)'); ?>
    calculates a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slerp">spherical linear interpolation</a>
    between two rotations. For <code>value</code> = 0 the result
    is <code>rotation1</code>, for <code>value</code> = 1 the result
    is <code>rotation2</code>, and between (and outside) the result is a nicely interpolated
    rotation on a unit sphere.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Example: see <a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/demo-models/blob/master/castle_script/rotations.x3dv">rotations.x3dv</a>
for a simple X3D Script using above rotation functions.</p>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>3x3 and 4x4 matrices are supported. Single- and double- precision.
X3D calls these matrix types <code>SFMatrix3f</code>, <code>SFMatrix4f</code>,
<code>SFMatrix3d</code>, <code>SFMatrix4d</code>.
Matrix is treated similar to an array of vectors (array of columns).</p>

<p><?php func('matrix', 'matrix(column1, column2, column3), matrix(column1, column2, column3, column4)'); ?>
 create a matrix. Each <code>column</code> argument is a vector.
Number or arguments determines if it's 3x3 or 4x4 matrix.
Type of arguments (single- or double- precision vectors) determines
if matrix is single or double precision.

<p><?php echo func('matrix_get', 'matrix_get(my_matrix, column_index)'); ?>
 gets matrix column. Allowed index values obviously depend on matrix size,
for example on <code>SFMatrix4f</code> you can use index 0, 1, 2, 3.
<?php echo func('matrix_set', 'matrix_set(my_matrix, column_index, column_value)'); ?>
 sets given matrix column (and returns new matrix, for comfort).</p>

<p><?php func('matrix_get_count', 'matrix_get_count(my_vec)'); ?> is available,
for analogy with <code>array_get_count</code> and <code>vector_get_count</code>.
Returns number of columns, 3 or 4. For now, non-uniform matrices are not
supported, so this is also the number of rows.</p>

<p>You can add, subtract, negate, multiply (by another matrix, or by scalar,
or by vector on the right side), divide (by scalar),
compare matrix using normal operators.
Linear interpolation by <?php func('lerp', 'lerp(fraction, matrix1, matrix2)'); ?>
 on matrices also works.</p>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p><?php func('image', 'image(width, height, components)'); ?> creates
a new image. <code>components</code> is the number of image components,
like in X3D <code>SFImage</code> field:

<ul>
  <li>1 component is grayscale image,
  <li>2 components is grayscale image with alpha channel,
  <li>3 components is RGB image,
  <li>4 components is RGB image with alpha channel.
</ul>

<p>Note that image contents are <i>not initialized</i> (meaning:
they are filled with random garbage in memory) by <code>image</code> function.
This is for the sake of speed.</p>

<p><?php func('image_load', 'image_load(url)'); ?> loads
an image from file. This is quite powerful utility, allowing you
to load textures at any time from a script. (It's not a security
problem, since you can do the same from normal X3D nodes like <code>ImageTexture</code>.)
URL may be relative to X3D file containing the Script node.</p>

<p><?php func('image_width', 'image_width(my_image)'); ?>,
<?php func('image_height', 'image_height(my_image)'); ?>,
<?php func('image_components', 'image_components(my_image)'); ?> return
width, height and number of image components.</p>

<p>For functions that get/set image contents, there are 3 variants of each
of them:

<ul>
  <li><p>Functions with <code>_color</code> suffix operate only on non-alpha channels
    of the image. For 1 and 2 component images, they take/return
    a single floating point value describing color intensity
    (in 0..1 range). For 3 and 4 component images, they take/return
    a 3-element vector with single precision, describing RGB color value.</p></li>

  <li><p>Functions with <code>_alpha</code> operate only on alpha channel
    of the image. They take/return a single floating point value
    describing alpha (opacity), in 0..1 range.</p></li>

  <li><p>Finally functions without alpha/color suffix operate on all image
    channels at once. For 1 component images, they take/return
    a single floating point value. For 2,3,4 component images,
    they take/return a vector (with single precision) describing
    color with alpha value. For images without alpha value (1 or 3
    components), these functions are exactly equivalent to <code>_color</code>
    functions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Functions to get/set image contents:

<ul>
  <li><p><?php func('image_get',  'image_get&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(my_image, x, y)'); ?>,<br/>
    <?php func('image_get_color', 'image_get_color(my_image, x, y)'); ?>,<br/>
    <?php func('image_get_alpha', 'image_get_alpha(my_image, x, y)'); ?><br/>
    Get single pixel's color/alpha.</p></li>

  <li><p><?php func('image_set',  'image_set&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(my_image, x, y, color_with_alpha)'); ?>,<br/>
    <?php func('image_set_color', 'image_set_color(my_image, x, y, color)'); ?>,<br/>
    <?php func('image_set_alpha', 'image_set_alpha(my_image, x, y, alpha)'); ?><br/>
    Set single pixel to given color/alpha.</p></li>

  <li><p>More "set" functions were planned, like <code>image_set_rectangle</code>,
    <code>image_apply_decal</code>, but finally I didn't have the nerve
    to implement everything possible :) Report if you would like any function to be added
    to CastleScript for images.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For comfort, <code>set</code> functions return back the image (that is,
the new value of 1st argument).</p>

<p>For example CastleScript programs that generate and process images,
see e.g. <a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/castlescript/mkimage_gradient.castlescript">mkimage_gradient.castlescript
(generate simple gradient image)</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/castlescript/mkimage_sobel_edge.castlescript">mkimage_sobel_edge.castlescript
(process any image with Sobel operator (edge detection))</a>.

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>None for now. Currently, you cannot process X3D nodes directly by
CastleScript. Whether it will ever be allowed in CastleScript, depends
on the "success" of CastleScript &mdash; if you write your own scripts
in CastleScript and feel that you need this, please report. Michalis
will be more than happy to add them :)

In case of uncertainty lexer is greedy, that is lexer tries to eat as much
characters as it can for a single token.</p>

<p>Case sensitivity: language is not case-sensitive.
That said, in the future in may be partially case-sensitive,
in places where you specify field/event names of X3D
since <i>whole X3D is case-sensitive</i>. So always specify
X3D field/event names with matching case.
