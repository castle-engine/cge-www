also can generate <code>*.kanim</code> files
from an VRML animation by interpolators.</p>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>The format is a series of static 3D frames. They can be inlined in a large XML file (as X3D or glTF), or they can be external files (in which case they can be any 3D format supported by the <i>Castle Game Engine</i>). Animation shows the transition from the first frame to the last. Where models are <i>structurally equal</i>, intermediate frames are created by a linear interpolation to show smooth changes.

<p>All the advantages and disadvantages of this format come from this simplicity. On one hand, it can be used to transfer <i>any</i> Blender animation to Castle Game Engine. On the other hand, it can be quite heavy: <i>loading large animations takes some time</i>, and they eat a significant amount of memory.</p>

<p>Some of these disadvantages may be mitigated in the future (as we will internally convert it to better X3D interpolator nodes). But it will always remain somewhat "heavy solution".</p>

<p>At the same time, it will always remain something that <i>can handle any Blender animation, right now</i>. As opposed to the X3D exporter (that currently cannot export Blender animation at all, and in the future will support a limited subset of Blender possibilities).</p>

<p>A temporary disadvantage (TODO) is that right now we do not interpolate at runtime using nice X3D interpolators. Instead, we generate a series of frames at loading, merge the tree when nodes are equal, and move through them using X3D <code>Switch</code> and <code>IntegerSequencer</code>. Once we improve this, the runtime memory usage will be <i>somewhat</i> better, and animation will be always perfectly smooth at runtime, and the collision detection will account for dynamic changes OK.

<!--p>If you work with 3D modeler that can export proper VRML animation
with interpolators, then you don't need to use Castle-Anim-Frames format.
Our engine handles events and interpolators perfectly.
Internally, they may even be converted (after loading) to precalculated
animations.</p-->

<!--p>There's also a crude converter from castle-anim-frames format to VRML/X3D
interpolators in our engine examples (see <code>examples/vrml/tools/castle_anim_frames_to_interpolators</code>).
It's a little crude (works only when you animate only a single mesh),
but may be enough for simple uses. So this is one way to generate an animated
VRML/X3D file from Blender: export from Blender to castle-anim-frames, then convert
castle-anim-frames to VRML/X3D.</p-->
