At 3.7.0 release: mention that view3dscene download links,

are now more visible on view3dscene webpage.

  <li><p>The pages describing our ('VRML/X3D implementation status', vrml_implementation_status.php) for each X3D component are much improved. Each component page starts with a very short introduction, describing what the component is and how it's used in the most typical cases. Also, the node names are links to actual X3D specification pages.</p>

    <p>The idea behind these improvements is to give interested developers (in particular, the ones not familiar with VRML/X3D yet) a way to orient themselves, in the large number of VRML/X3D nodes. We give an easy overview of the component and the links to X3D specification to learn more details.</p>

    <p>And everything is of course interspersed with the details about our engine implementation, it's strength and current limitations.</p></li>

'Welcome to the weekly news :) As usual, remember you can try out all the improvements right now by using our <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/">nightly builds</a>.

<ul>
  <li><p>All <b>X3D dragging sensors (PlaneSensor, SphereSensor, CylinderSensor)</b> are implemented now. Very nice tools to allow user to edit portions of your 3D scenes &mdash; PlaneSensor allows moving, SphereSensor allows free rotation, CylinderSensor allows rotations constrained around an axis.</p>

    <p>I encourage you to try them &mdash; test e.g. X3D conformace models
    (<a href="http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/Conformance/Sensors/PlaneSensor/">PlaneSensor</a>,
     <a href="http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/Conformance/Sensors/SphereSensor/">SphereSensor</a>,
     <a href="http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/Conformance/Sensors/CylinderSensor/">CylinderSensor</a>)
     or VRML 97 annotated reference examples
    (<a href="http://accad.osu.edu/~pgerstma/class/vnv/resources/info/AnnotatedVrmlRef/ch3-334.htm">PlaneSensor</a>,
     <a href="http://accad.osu.edu/~pgerstma/class/vnv/resources/info/AnnotatedVrmlRef/ch3-344.htm">SphereSensor</a>,
     <a href="http://accad.osu.edu/~pgerstma/class/vnv/resources/info/AnnotatedVrmlRef/ch3-315.htm">CylinderSensor</a>)
    or our Kambi VRML test suite (see SVN, files <tt>x3d/xxx_sensor*.x3dv</tt>). They allow you to really easily add great interactivity to your VRML/X3D scenes.</p>

    <p>Also related to sensors: fixed behavior when multiple pointing-device sensors are siblings (and so should be simultaneously activated).</p></li>

  <li><p>New functions for <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/kambi_script.html#section_functions_rotation"><b>KambiScript to handle rotations</b> (SVN docs)</a>.</p></li>

  <li><p>Changing <b><tt>Transform</tt> node containing light sources</b> is greatly optimized now.</p>

    <p>This also causes a regression: if you instantiate this light source (through DEF/USE), and then try to animate it by changing it\'s Transform node &mdash; too many light instances will be updated. This is a regression (something that used to work correctly, but now doesn\'t work), but I feel it\'s justified &mdash; while previous behavior was correct, it was also awfully slow (bringing even trivial scenes to a speed of a few FPS), so the new behavior is at least usable in common cases.</p>

    <p>Various fixes along the way. Including shadow map regeneration when light changes.</p></li>

  <li><p><b>Mouse wheel</b> is supported. It is used for zoom (in camera Examine mode), scrolling text (in various message boxes), it can also be used as a (configurable) shortcut for ' . news_a_href_page('castle', 'castle') . ' actions (default is to scroll through inventory). <small>Developers: see <tt>TGLWindow.OnMouseWheel</tt> for using this in your own programs.</small></p></li>

  <li><p>Warnings after loading a model are signalled by a <b>"%d warnings" button</b> by ' . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . '. This way warnings are still clearly visible (the button only disappears after you use it on this model), but don\'t make an "obstacle" (modal box) to viewing the model.</p></li>

  <li><p>I added to NURBS implementation status page notes about <a href="http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/vrml_implementation_nurbs.php#section_homogeneous_coordinates">control points in homogeneous coordinates</a>, thanks to Stephen H. France for noticing the problem and Joerg Scheurich (from White Dune) for offering an explanation.</p></li>

  <li><p>Smooth camera transitions under Windows are fixed.</p></li>

  <li><p>OrthoViewpoint improvements, to internally adjust fieldOfView to keep aspect ratio. (<a href="https://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_test_suite/x3d/ortho_viewpoint.x3dv">OrthoViewpoint.fieldOfView demo</a>)</p></li>

'<p>As you can see, this week brings many improvements to our website. I hope it\'s now easier to navigate, and things look a little better :)</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>We have a nice header, visible at the top of every page, with most important links / sections clearly emphasized. Among other things, this avoids the previous looong index page. And makes the important but previously too-easy-to-miss links ' . news_a_href_page('"Support"', 'support') . ' and ' . news_a_href_page('"Engine" (for developers)', 'kambi_vrml_game_engine') . ' more visible.</p></li>

  <li><p>Some sections get a sidebar on the right for easier navigation. This is especially useful with ' . news_a_href_page('VRML/X3D', 'vrml_x3d') . ' section, which has a huge number of useful content especially under ' . news_a_href_page('Implementation status', 'vrml_implementation_status') . '.</p></li>

  <li><p>We also have "breadcrumbs" visible on pages deeper in the hierarchy, like ' . news_a_href_page('Shaders implementation status', 'vrml_implementation_shaders') . '. Together with header and sidebar they (hopefully) clearly show you where you are in the website.</p></li>

  <li><p>New ' . news_a_href_page('VRML/X3D', 'vrml_x3d') . ' page, an introduction to the whole VRML/X3D section, explains <i>"What is VRML / X3D"</i> in a short and friendly way. This will hopefully explain newcomers (to our engine, and/or X3D) why this 3D format is so great that I based my whole engine on it :)</p></li>

  <li>Our news are nicer now, with each ' . news_a_href_page('news', 'news') . ' post displayed on a separate page (previous "one page with all the news" was getting awfully long to load).  You get nice <i>Newer / Older</i> links and a sidebar to navigate among our news posts easily.</li>

'<p>The quest to "cleanup and optimize" all around the engine continues :) New features are listed below. As usual, you\'re welcome to test them by trying our <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/">nightly builds</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p><b>Camera improvements</b>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><i>Examine camera got a functionality boost</i>, and as a result some long-time troubles with switching camera modes are fixed now. Examine camera correctly honours now Viewpoint nodes, and switching camera modes preserves the current view, and switching viewpoints preserves camera mode. Thanks to Jens van Schelve for reporting this and pushing me to fix this :)</p>

        <p><small>Developers: engine has a new camera class, TUniversalCamera, that is created by default for VRML/X3D scenes and offers a functionality of both Examine and Walk navigation methods. If you previously used something like <tt>"(SceneManager.Camera as TWalkCamera)"</tt> to access Walk-specific properties, you may need to use now <tt>"(SceneManager as TUniversalCamera).Walk"</tt> to use them. Or just try to use the basic <tt>TCamera</tt> features, without downcasting to specific camera descendants.</small></p></li>

      <li><p><i>Smooth transitions</i> between viewpoints are implemented. They also follow X3D <tt>NavigationInfo.transitionType</tt>, <tt>NavigationInfo.transitionTime</tt> fields (<a href="http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/ISO-IEC-19775-1.2-X3D-AbstractSpecification/Part01/components/navigation.html#NavigationInfo">X3D spec</a>).</p></li>

      <li><p><i>All camera moving and rotating speeds are now expressed inside the engine in nice units/per second</i>.</p>

        <p>Also, <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/kambi_vrml_extensions.html#section_ext_head_bobbing">headBobbingDistance is renamed into much more suitable headBobbingTime (link to SVN docs)</a>, and is also expressed in seconds now (divide by 50 to get the same behavior with old values).</p></li>
    </ul></li>

  <li><p>New sensors implemented:<br/>
    <b><tt>PlaneSensor</tt></b>
      (<a href="http://web3d.org/x3d/specifications/ISO-IEC-19775-1.2-X3D-AbstractSpecification/Part01/components/pointingsensor.html#PlaneSensor">X3D spec</a>,

  <li><p>Victor Amat updated the demo using our <a href="http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/kambi_vrml_extensions.php#section_ext_rendered_texture">RenderedTexture</a> to get <b>mirrors on a flat surface</b>.

'A lot of work happened last month, as I\'m sure <a href="http://cia.vc/stats/project/vrmlengine">SVN statistics</a> confirm :) Some highlights:

<ol>
  <li><p>VRML/X3D features implemented:

    <ul>
      <li><b>ClipPlane</b> node is handled.
      <li><b>ColorRGBA</b> node is handled. Also related VRML 1.0 Material-per-vertex/face is now much faster.<!-- (uses <tt>glColorMaterial</tt>).-->
      <li><a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/kambi_vrml_extensions.html#section_ext_rendered_texture"><b>RenderedTexture.rendering, viewing, projection</b> (link to SVN docs)</a> output events are implemented.
      <li><b>TimeSensor.enabled, cycleTime</b> are now handled correctly.
      <li><a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/kambi_vrml_extensions.html#section_ext_toggler"><b>Toggler</b> (link to SVN docs) </a> node (simple event utility) from InstantReality is handled.
    </ul>

  <li><p>Stephen H. France prepared <b><a href="http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/abbreviated_x3d_specs_for_users.chm">X3D specification including Kambi extensions</a> and <a href="http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/kambiscript_language.chm">KambiScript reference</a></b> in the CHM format. The CHM format makes them easy to browse and search. Thanks!</p>

  <li><p><b>Primitives</b>: more nodes (boxes, spheres, cones, cylinders) are now processed by converting them to <tt>IndexedFaceSet</tt> or similar low-level geometry. (This is called the <i>"proxy mechanism"</i> in sources.) And the whole mechanism is now much more efficient, so e.g. <tt>Extrusion</tt>, <tt>Teapot</tt>, NURBS curves and surfaces are processed now faster.</p>

    <p>The immediate gain from it is that Box, Cone, Cylinder, Sphere <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/kambi_vrml_extensions.html#section_ext_tex_coord">get the "texCoord" field (link to SVN docs)</a>. In particular they can use our bump mapping features, they work with multi-texturing and 3D textures fully correctly, and they can be shadow map receivers (although this last thing still needs a little work).</p>

    <!--p>Developers: this makes a little incompatible change. TVRMLShape.Geometry/State now may return something more temporary. Most code should work out-of-the-box without changes (and work faster!), but if you e.g. played with removing the geometry nodes &mdash; you should consider using TVRMLShape.OriginalGeometry node instead, see also TVRMLScene.RemoveShapeGeometry.</p-->
  </li>

  <li><p><b>Events</b>: the code responsible for changing the VRML/X3D graph (in particular, through the events) got a few refreshments. Some events work better or faster now (e.g. <tt>RenderedTexture.dimensions</tt> and <tt>depthMap</tt> can be changed through events.)</p>

    <p>A couple of large optimizations for <tt>Transform</tt> animation were implemented.</p>

  <!--li><p>Next view3dscene release will include scripts to easier setup desktop (GNOME) integration.</li-->

  <li><a href="http://www.punkuser.net/vsm/">Variance Shadow Maps</a> are also implemented. Although their implementation is not optimal yet, and should be treated as experimental. You can easily turn them on by <i>View -&gt; Shadow Maps -&gt; Variance Shadow Maps</i> menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>For now, you can test these features by using <tt>view3dscene</tt> from our <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/~michalis/vrmlengine-snapshots/">nightly builds</a>.</p>

'<p>You can now have many viewports on the 2D window to observe your 3D world from various cameras. You can make e.g. split-screen games (each view displays different player), 3D modeling programs (where you usually like to see the scene from various angles at once), or just show a view from some special world place (like a security camera).</p>

<p>Your viewports may be placed in any way you like on the screen, they can even be overlapping (one viewport partially obscures another). Each viewport has it\'s own dimensions, own camera, but all viewports share the same 3D world. Each viewport has also it\'s own rendering methods, so you can derive e.g. a specialized viewport that always shows wireframe view of the 3D world.</p>

<p>This very nice feature is implemented thanks to the scene manager framework. The scene manager itself also acts as a viewport (if <tt>DefaultViewport</tt> is true), which is comfortable for simple programs where one viewport is enough. When <tt>DefaultViewport</tt> is false, scene manager is merely a container for your 3D world, referenced by custom viewports (<tt>TKamViewport</tt> classes).</p>

<p>See the screenshots on the right and <tt>kambi_vrml_game_engine/examples/vrml/multiple_viewports.lpr</tt> example program in the SVN for demo.</p>

<p>Other improvements include new button rendered in the OpenGL (<tt>TKamGLButton</tt> in <tt>kambi_vrml_game_engine/src/ui/opengl/glcontrols.pas</tt> unit), you can see it on the screenshots too. This is the start of a promised 2D controls library for the engine. The idea is that such button may be easily themed for your OpenGL game, to match game mood and graphics.</p>

<p>Also there\'s a <tt>TKamGLImage</tt> control, and lot\'s of bugfixes stabilizing engine 2.0.0. It\'s pretty much finished now &mdash; expect engine 2.0.0 and view3dscene 3.5 releases very shortly :)</p>'),

'<p>To sweeten the wait for engine 2.0.0 (and castle 1.0.0) releases: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DTu9tEn44g">here\'s a short demo movie</a> with a cloth animation (cloth simulated and animated in <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>) rendered using our engine with bump mapping. The point here is that both 3D meshes and lights may be animated in real-time and bump mapping works perfectly.</p>

<p>This was always possible, but some recent improvements made this much easier. Namely:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Our <tt>examples/vrml/bump_mapping</tt> demo now works with animated objects without any trouble.</li>
  <li>Our <tt>examples/vrml/tools/kanim_to_interpolators</tt> is now slightly more general converter from ' . news_a_href_page('KAnim format', 'kanim_format') . ' to VRML/X3D. This means it\'s possible to make "normal" animated VRML/X3D models by ' . news_a_href_page('exporting from Blender to kanim', 'blender_stuff') . ', then converting kanim to VRML/X3D. Convertion kanim-&gt;VRML/X3D is totally lossless, so the whole setup works quite flawlessly &mdash; at least for this simple cloth demo.</li>
</ol>

<p>The source model is in SVN, in <tt>kambi_vrml_test_suite/vrml_2/kambi_extensions/bump_mapping/cloth/</tt>. You can open it with the bump_mapping example (from our engine sources) or view3dscene.</p>'),

'<p>Nearly all existing programs (examples and normal games) are now happily converted to the new <i>scene manager</i> approach.

This means that engine 2.0.0 is coming along nicely and will soon be released :)</p>

<p>In particular, ' . news_a_href_page('The Castle', 'castle') . ' source code is converted to use the scene manager. This means that finally you can construct <i>"The Castle"</i> interactive levels by VRML/X3D events, using VRML/X3D time, touch sensors, key sensors, proximity sensors (see <a href="http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/ISO-IEC-19775-1.2-X3D-AbstractSpecification/index.html">X3D spec</a> for sensor nodes docs), scripts in ' . news_a_href_page('KambiScript', 'kambi_script') . ' and such. To celebrate this, I plan to add a little eye-candy to castle\'s "Fountain" level, and then officially release the final <b>"The Castle 1.0.0"</b> along with <b>engine 2.0.0</b>. After that, work on "The Castle 2" may begin :)</p>

<p>More teasers about the <i>Castle 1.0.0</i> release and plans for <i>Castle 2</i> in later post hopefully next week.</p>

<p>Getting back to the engine work, one important news for developers:  <!-- teaser --> I renamed one of the most important new classes: what was <tt>TBase3D</tt> is now called "<a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/Base3D.T3D.html">T3D</a>". (Reasoning: this is a shorter and better name. "Base" prefix was just uncomfortable, esp. since descendants were no longer "base" 3D objects but they were have to be called "TBase3D" in many places.)</p>

<p>Also, some other classes (<tt>T[Custom]Translated/List3D</tt>) renamed to follow <tt>T3DXxx</tt> pattern, like <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/Base3D.T3DList.html">T3DList</a> and <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/GL3D.T3DTranslated.html">T3DTranslated</a>. That is, I moved the "3D" part of the name to the beginning. (Reasoning: looks just better, and is consequent with usage of other common prefixes like TKamXxx and TVRMLXxx classes. General rule is that "common part should be the prefix, not suffix", as this is easier to see (and presents itself better when identifiers are sorted alphabetically in API docs etc.).)</p>

<p>These renames concern only new classes, not released anyway yet (and we know anyway that engine 2.0.0 will break some compatibility, so let\'s take this opportunity and "get" the important classes names right, Ok? :) ).</p>

<p>Note: I edited the previous news post (the one ~2 weeks ago) to reflect these renames. I don\'t usually edit my news posts after publishing :), but in this case it was important to fix it. Otherwise some classes and code mentioned in the previous news article would not exist.</p>'),

)) . '

<p>During the last weeks I did a lot of work on the engine API. Especially the new <b>Scene Manager</b> approach makes quite a revolutionary change, and there\'s also <i>2D Controls manager</i>, better <i>Lazarus components</i> and many more. Together, I feel these are so important for developers using my engine that the next engine version will be bumped to proud <i>2.0.0</i> :) To be released next month.</p>

<p>Not much noticeable for a normal user (sorry; although there are various fixes and improvements here and there). Below news post turned out quite long, and I\'ll keep passing you links to the <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/">current API reference of SVN code</a>, so... developers: keep reading if you\'re interested, and others: well, this may get dirty, so you can stop reading now :)</p>

<!-- teaser -->

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The number one reason behind all these changes is that it was too difficult to add new stuff to your window. This concerned 3D stuff, mainly the two most important classes of our engine: <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/VRMLGLScene.TVRMLGLScene.html">TVRMLGLScene</a> and <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/VRMLGLAnimation.TVRMLGLAnimation.html">TVRMLGLAnimation</a>. And it also concerned 2D controls, for example our menu with fancy GUI sliders: <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/GLMenu.TGLMenu.html">TGLMenu</a> (this was used in ' . news_a_href_page('castle', 'castle') . ' and recent <tt>examples/vrml/terrain</tt> demo).</p>

    <p><b>The goal</b>: the goal (already achieved :) ) is to allow you to make a full 3D model viewer / VRML browser (with collisions, fully optimized rendering etc.) by this simple code:</p>

<pre style="background: #DDD">
var
  Window: TGLUIWindow;
  SceneManager: TKamSceneManager;
  Scene: TVRMLGLScene;
begin
  Scene := TVRMLGLScene.Create(Application { Owner that will free the Scene });
  Scene.Load(\'my_scene.x3d\');
  Scene.Spatial := [ssRendering, ssDynamicCollisions];
  Scene.ProcessEvents := true;

  SceneManager := TKamSceneManager.Create(Application);
  SceneManager.Items.Add(Scene);
  SceneManager.MainScene := Scene;

  Window := TGLUIWindow.Create(Application);
  Window.Controls.Add(SceneManager);
  Window.InitAndRun;
end.
</pre>

    <p>(The source code of this is in <a href="https://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_game_engine/examples/vrml/scene_manager_basic.lpr">scene_manager_basic</a> demo inside engine examples. There\'s also more extensive demo in the <a href="https://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_game_engine/examples/vrml/scene_manager_demos.lpr">scene_manager_demos</a> sample.)</p>

    <p>This looks nice a relatively straighforward, right? You create 3D object (<tt>Scene</tt>), you create 3D world (<tt>SceneManager</tt>), and a window to display the 3D world (<tt>Window</tt>). What is really the point here is that you immediately know how to add a second 3D object: just create <tt>Scene2</tt>, and add it to <tt>SceneManager.Items</tt>.</p>

    <p>The idea of <i>scene manager</i> will soon be explained in more detail, for now let\'s go a litle back in time and see what was wrong without the scene manager:</p>

    <p><b>The trouble</b>: our existing classes were nicely encapsulating some functionality (showing menu, rendering VRML etc.) but they <i>were a pain to add to your window / 3D world</i>.</p>

    <p>You could use something like <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/GLWindowVRMLBrowser.TGLWindowVRMLBrowser.html">TGLWindowVRMLBrowser</a> (or equivalent Lazarus component, <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/KambiVRMLBrowser.TKamVRMLBrowser.html">TKamVRMLBrowser</a>) but these offered too little flexibility. They were made to allow easily loading <i>only one scene</i>.</p>

    <p>For anything more complicated, you had to directly create your <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/VRMLGLScene.TVRMLGLScene.html">TVRMLGLScene</a> etc. classes, and (this is the key point) to handle various window / camera / callbacks to connect the 3D scene with a camera and with a window. For example, you had to register window <tt>OnIdle</tt> callback to increment VRML scene time (to keep animations running etc.) You had to register <tt>OnKeyDown</tt>, <tt>OnKeyUp</tt> and pass key events to VRML scene (to make VRML sensors work), <tt>OnMouseXxx</tt> callbacks had to be passed to handle VRML touch sensors, <tt>OnDraw</tt> to handle scene rendering. You also had to register camera callbacks (<a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/Cameras.TWalkCamera.html#OnMoveAllowed"><tt>OnMoveAllowed</tt></a>, <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/Cameras.TWalkCamera.html#OnGetCameraHeight"><tt>OnGetCameraHeight</tt></a>) to connect collision detection with your 3D scene. And the list goes on...</p>

    <p>As a witness to all these troubles, have a look at implementation of <tt>GLWindowVRMLBrowser</tt> or (nearly identical) implementation of <tt>KambiVRMLBrowser</tt> is last released engine version. They are long and clumsy. In current SVN code, they are nice, short and clean, and also more flexible (can handle many 3D objects, not just 1 VRML scene).</p>

    <p><b>The solution(s):</b> There are actually two solutions, one directed at 3D objects (living in the 3D world), the other at 2D controls (merely taking some space on the 2D window) . They are quite similar, and nicely playing with each other:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p><i>For 3D objects</i>: we have a base class <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/Base3D.T3D.html">T3D</a> from which <i>all</i> other 3D objects are derived. For example, <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/VRMLGLScene.TVRMLGLScene.html">TVRMLGLScene</a> and <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/VRMLGLAnimation.TVRMLGLAnimation.html">TVRMLGLAnimation</a> are both descendants of <tt>T3D</tt> now. There are some other helper 3D objects (<a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/Base3D.T3DList.html">T3DList</a> - list of other 3D objects, and <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/GL3D.T3DTranslated.html">T3DTranslated</a> - translated other 3D object). And the real beauty is that you can easily derive your own <tt>T3D</tt> descendants, just override a couple methods and you get 3D objects that can be visible, can collide etc. in 3D world.</p>

        <p>Now, what to do with your 3D objects? Add them to your 3D world, of course. The new great class that is fully implemented now is the <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/KambiSceneManager.TKamSceneManager.html">TKamSceneManager</a>. In every program you create an instance of this class (or your own dencendant of <tt>TKamSceneManager</tt>), and you add your 3D objects to the scene manager. Scene manager keeps the whole knowledge about your 3D world, as a tree of <tt>T3D</tt> objects. After adding your whole 3D world to the scene manager, you can add the scene manager to <tt>Controls</tt> (more on this next), and then scene manager will receive all necessary events from your window, and will pass them to all interested 3D objects. Also scene manager connects your camera, and defines your viewport where 3D world is rendered through this camera.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p><i>For 2D controls</i>: quite similar solution is used, although with some details different. All stuff that had to receive window events must derive from base <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/UIControls.TUIControl.html">TUIControl</a> class. This means that <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/GLMenu.TGLMenu.html">TGLMenu</a> is now a descendant of <tt>TUIControl</tt>, and in the future I would like to have a small library of generally-usable simple 2D controls available here. Also note that <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/KambiSceneManager.TKamSceneManager.html">TKamSceneManager</a> is <tt>TUIControl</tt> descendant, since scene manager by default acts as a viewport (2D rectangle) through which you can see your 3D world. (Possibility to easily add custom viewports from the same scene manager is the next thing on my to-do list.)</p>

        <p>To actually use the <tt>TUIControl</tt>, you add it to the window\'s <tt>Controls</tt> list. If you use Lazarus component, then you\'re interested in <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/KambiGLControl.TKamOpenGLControl.html#Controls">TKamOpenGLControl.Controls</a> list. If you use our own window library, you\'re intersted in the <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/GLWindow.TGLUIWindow.html#Controls">TGLUIWindow.Controls</a>. Once control is added to the controls list, it will automatically receive all interesting events from our window.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>That\'s it, actually. Thank you for reading this far, and I hope you\'ll like the changes &mdash; you can try SVN source code already and let me know how it works for you in practice.</p>

  </li>

  <li><p>Other changes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The <i>Lazarus integration of the engine is better</i>, with many old classes reworked as components. This is also tied to the previous change, because both <tt>T3D</tt> and <tt>TUIControl</tt> are descendants of <tt>TComponent</tt> &mdash; which means that important classes of our engine, like <tt>TVRMLGLScene</tt>, and also the cameras are now components that can be registered on Lazarus palette.</p>

        <p>This is not yet finished: some important properties of these classes are not published, or not possible to design from the IDE. For example, you cannot add items to the <tt>TKamOpenGLControl.Controls</tt> list yet from the IDE. This doesn\'t limit your possibilities, it only means that you\'ll have to do some work by writing source code as opposed to just clicking in Lazarus. Things for sure are already a lot better than in previous engine release.</p>

        <p>Mouse look is now also available in Lazarus <tt>TKamOpenGLControl</tt> component.</p>
      </li>

      <li><p><tt>T3D/TUIControl</tt> give various improvements to all 2D/3D objects. For examples, <tt>TVRMLGLScene</tt> automatically sets cursor to "hand" when it\'s over a touch sensor. In fact, every <tt>T3D</tt> and <tt>TUIControl</tt> can affect cursor by <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/UIControls.TUIControl.html#Cursor">Cursor</a> property.</p></li>

      <li><p>If you do not explicitly create a camera for the scene manager, a suitable one is automatically created, see <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/KambiSceneManager.TKamSceneManager.html#Camera">TKamSceneManager.Camera</a>.</p></li>

      <li><p>All "navigator" classes, fields etc. are renamed to "camera". So e.g. <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/Cameras.TExamineCamera.html">TExamineCamera</a> is just a new name for our good old <tt>TExamineNavigator</tt> and such.</p>

        <p>Old names <i>navigator</i> were coined to emphasize the fact that they do not have to represent "real" camera that is used to display the 3D scene on the screen, they can be used to manipulate any 3D object of your scene. For example <tt>shadow_fields</tt> demo uses 4 examine navigators to manipulate various scene elements, <tt>rift</tt> uses special walk navigator to represent position of the player in the room, etc. But I decided that the name is just confusing, as most of the time you use this as a "normal camera". Advanced users can probably grasp the fact that in fact "camera" doesn\'t have to be used to display whole scene from the screen.</p></li>

      <li><p>GTK 2 backend of our <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/GLWindow.TGLWindow.html">TGLWindow</a> class was much reworked. Namely, 1. we no longer use GTK\'s <tt>gtk_idle_add</tt> to implement our <tt>OnIdle</tt> callbacks and 2. GTK\'s "expose" signal no longer calls directly <tt>OnDraw</tt> callback . These caused an endless stream of troubles with stability, related to GTK idle events priorities. Our new solution is much simpler, solving some recent problems and removing ugly workarounds for the old ones.

        <p>For more in-depth discussion of past problems, reasonings and solutions, see the document <a href="https://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_game_engine/src/glwindow/gtk/why_not_using_gtk_idle.txt">why_not_gtk_idle.txt</a>.
      </li>

      <li><p>A minor improvements to the <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/GLWindow.TGLWindow.html">TGLWindow</a> are the <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/GLWindow.TGLWindow.html#MessageOK">MessageOK</a> and the <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-snapshots/docs/reference/html/GLWindow.TGLWindow.html#MessageYesNo">MessageYesNo</a> methods, proving native-looking (GTK, WinAPI etc.) message boxes.</p></li>

      <li><p>Oh, and f you\'re trying to compile the engine with newest FPC 2.4.0, please use engine SVN source for now. Current released tar.gz sources compile only with &lt;= 2.2.4. This problem will of course disappear after new engine is released.</p></li>

  <li>
    <p>There\'s a new demo in engine <a href="http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/kambi_vrml_game_engine.php#section_svn">SVN sources</a>: <tt>terrain</tt> (look inside <tt>kambi_vrml_game_engine/examples/vrml/terrain/</tt> directory). It shows basic procedural terrain generation. Uses cosine interpolated noise, summed by <i>Fractional Brownian Motion</i> (which is a fancy way of saying "sum a few scaled noise functions"&nbsp;:)&nbsp;).</p>

    <p>It can also load a terrain data from <a href="http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/">SRTM (.hgt files)</a> (for example, <a href="http://netgis.geo.uw.edu.pl/srtm/Europe/">sample files for Europe are here</a>). And it can display a terrain defined by mathematical expression, like <i>sin(x*10) * sin(y*10)</i> (see <a href="http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/kambi_script.php">KambiScript language reference</a> for full syntax and functions available for math expressions).</p>

    <p>If you\'re interested in some background, <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/models/m_perlin.htm">this is the simplest introduction to "making noise"</a> (although beware that it\'s actually not about Perlin noise :), Perlin noise is a "gradient noise", not covered there).</p>

    <p>I would like to extend this <tt>terrain</tt> demo to something much larger (infinite terrain rendering, render with normals, cover with a couple layers of textures, add water surface, maybe render with Precomputed Radiance Transfer (taken from my other demo) etc.). For now, it\'s a start :)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Developers will note large changes in the layout of <tt>kambi_vrml_game_engine</tt> archive (and SVN directory). (links below point to appropriate <a href="http://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vrmlengine/">viewvc</a> URL, for your convenience)</p>

    <ol>
      <li>All "core" sources are moved to the <a href="http://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_game_engine/src/"><tt>src/</tt> subdirectory</a>, to keep them separate from other stuff (packages, doc, tests etc.).

      <li><a href="http://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_game_engine/examples/"><tt>examples/</tt> subdirectory</a> was moved to the top. I should have done this a long time ago.  If you want to look at VRML demos, now you just go to <tt>examples/vrml/</tt> subdirectory, which is hopefully obvious to new developers. (Previously, you had to dig into cryptically-named <tt>3dmodels.gl/examples/</tt>)

      <!-- teaser </li></ol></li></ol> -->

      <li>Also, some subdirectory names changes, and some units moved around.
        <ul>
          <li>We have new <a href="http://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_game_engine/src/glwindow/">subdirectory for <tt>glwindow</tt></a> specific stuff (since the distinction what is for GLWindow, and what is not, is important to many developers; e.g. if you always want to use Lazarus OpenGL control, then GLWindow isn\'t really useful for you).
          <li>We have new <a href="http://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_game_engine/src/ui/">subdirectory for <tt>ui</tt></a>. This contains now the navigator and GLMenu &mdash; both things were available already, but now are implemented as <tt>TUIControl</tt> descendants, handled in more uniform fashion. In the future, I want to extend this, to make more OpenGL controls this way. The very scene manager may be treated as such "control" one day.
          <li>I noticed that the most important directories of our engine had a little cryptic naming: 3dgraph, 3dmodels, 3dmodels.gl. After a little shuffling, the new names are <a href="http://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_game_engine/src/3d/">3d</a>, <a href="http://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_game_engine/src/vrml/">vrml</a>, <a href="http://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_game_engine/src/vrml/opengl/">vrml/opengl/</a> &mdash; this should make things much clearer.
        </ul>
      <li>A minor thing is also that units Glw_Navigated, Glw_Win, Glw_Demo are gone, along with the one-unit package kambi_glwindow_navigated. I never liked these units, they were just handy shortcuts for simple demo programs. All normal programs should declare and explicitly create TGLWindow instance themselves, this is just 2 more lines of code but gives you better understanding what TGLWindow is and is more clean IMO.
      <li>Also, new kambi_vrml_game_engine*.tar.gz archives will contain offline HTML docs by pasdoc (the same ones <a href="http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/apidoc/html/index.html">as available online</a>).
    </ol>

Basically, this allows using the engine in closed-source programs, as long as you keep open your improvements to the engine.</p>

    <p>I had a long thought before this decision, always and still being a free software fanatic :) <!-- The text <i>In the future I may change the license to more liberal than GNU GPL &mdash; most probably to modified LGPL</i> was present in the "license" section since a few years. --> I wrote a short summary of my thoughts, <span ' .

      <li><p>The initial insight is that with strict GPL, potential proprietary users of the engine wouldn\'t "open" their product just to use our engine. Instead they would move their interest elsewhere. We\'re <a href="http://openvrml.org/">not</a> <a href="http://freewrl.sourceforge.net/">the only</a> free/open VRML/X3D engine out there, neither we\'re the <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">the</a> <a href="http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/">only</a> free/open 3d/game engine out there, and everyone else is available under LGPL (or even more permissible licenses).</p></li>

      <li><p>The common answer to above argument is that "popularity of the engine is not all that matters". LGPL is, ultimately, a permission to make closed-source software.</p>

        <p>The counter-thought to this is that LGPL still protects the freedom of my engine. You still have to share modifications to the engine, so it\'s not like properietary software can get all the benefits in some "unfair" way.</p></li>

  <li><p>Victor Amat implemented demos of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Space_Ambient_Occlusion">Screen Space Ambient Occlusion</a> using our <tt>GeneratedShadowMap</tt>. The complete examples, with shaders, are available inside our <a href="https://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_test_suite/x3d/shadow_maps/">x3d/shadow_maps/ directory in kambi_vrml_test_suite (SVN only right now)</a>. Many thanks!</p>

    <p>Be sure to test these examples with view3dscene from <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/~michalis/vrmlengine-snapshots/">nightly builds</a>, as various problems reported by Victor (related to generating shadow maps) were fixed along the way.</p>

    <p>Some demo screenshots are on the right. They show the same view with/and without SSAO. (The comparison is somewhat unfair, as "without SSAO" versions just have GLSL shaders turned off. But the point is that they don\'t have smooth shadows (occlusion)).</p></li>

  <li><p>Documentation of our "VRML / X3D implementation status" was refactored, each X3D component has now separate page with support details.

  <!-- Previous documentation (just one long page with stream of information) was fine a long time ago, when so little of VRML/X3D standards was implemented that it was sensible to mention only things that are actually working.

<p>Implementation of NURBS is progressing very nicely.

  <li>Texture handling code was refactored last week: we have much cleaner implementation now, various bump mapping fixes were done by the way, and all texture generating nodes use now OpenGL framebuffer (possibly faster, and texture dimensions no longer limited by window size).</li>
  <li><tt>Examine</tt> mode improved, to be more feature-rich like <tt>Walk</tt> mode: works nicely with <tt>LOD</tt> and <tt>ProximitySensor</tt> nodes, you can click on <tt>TouchSensor</tt> and such in <tt>Examine</tt> mode, you can initiate ray-tracer in view3dscene from <tt>Examine</tt> mode.</li>

<p>New features implemented last month in our engine:</p>

  <li>New extensions to easily make

  <li><i>Hardware occlusion query</i> may be activated for rendering,
    this can speed browsing large

    and more involved algorithm <a href="http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter06.html">Coherent Hierarchical Culling (see GPU Gems 2, Chapter 6)</a>.
    view3dscene has menu options (<i>View -&gt; ... Occlusion Query</i>) to try it all.
    </li>
  <li>And many other things: fixes and optimizations for <tt>GeneratedCubeMapTexture</tt>,
    glViewImage improvements (you no longer have to open files from command-line),
    S3TC compressed textures (from DDS; usable as textures, also viewable in glViewImage),
    sorting transparent shapes (for better blending),
    exit shortcut for view3dscene is Ctrl+W (escape was too error-prone).

<p>Hi! I didn\'t post a message here since some time, but rest assured that the development of next engine version continues :) Things already implemented in the SVN include:

<ul>
  <li>X3D multi-texturing.</li>
  <li>X3D cube map nodes.</li>
  <li>This also means that DDS file format (for <tt>ImageCubeMapTexture</tt>) is implemented (both reading and writing, you can even use glViewImage as a simple DDS editor).</li>
  <li>This includes generating textures on the fly (for <tt>GeneratedCubeMapTexture</tt>).</li>
  <li>As extensions, I added texture generation modes "<tt>WORLDSPACEREFLECTIONVECTOR</tt>" and "<tt>WORLDSPACENORMAL</tt>" (analogous to X3D standard modes in CAMERA space) to make simulating real reflections trivial.</li>
  <li>There is also quite cool new feature in view3dscene to catch a "screenshot" of 3D world around you as a cube map (DDS, or six separate normal images).</li>
  <li>Passing almost all possible VRML types to GLSL shaders is implemented.</li>
  <li>..and a lot of other cool features are already implemented :)</li>
</ul>

<p>The plan for the next release (view3dscene 3.4, engine 1.8) is to polish implementation of all above (yes, there are some known problems, also <tt>GeneratedCubeMapTexture</tt> implementation is severely unoptimal now), and add related texturing and GLSL features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3D texturing (that\'s easy since we already have DDS).</li>
  <li>Basic implementation of <a href="http://www.instantreality.org/documentation/nodetype/RenderedTexture/"><tt>RenderedTexture</tt></a> from InstantReality (that\'s easy since it\'s internally simpler than <tt>GeneratedCubeMapTexture</tt>).</li>
  <li>Finish GLSL stuff by supporting X3D attributes nodes.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the impatient: <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/~michalis/vrmlengine-snapshots/">nightly builds of vrmlengine binaries (including view3dscene) are available.</a> They are build automatically every night using current SVN code. Use at your own risk, of course &mdash; they <i>do</i> contain some known bugs. For now, they are made for Linux and Windows (32-bit).</p>

<p>This week I implemented a demo of <a href="http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter14.html">Dynamic Ambient Occlusion</a> using our engine.</p>

<p>In related news, last month I also implemented a demo of <a href="http://www.kunzhou.net/#shadow-field">Shadow Fields</a>. (I forgot to brag about it earlier, so I\'m doing it now :) ).</p>

<p>An extremely short summary: both techniques strive to make low-frequency soft shadows (in other words, the kind of shadows you usually see in the Real World) in dynamic 3D environment.</p>

<p>For now, they are just implemented as demos, and are not easily available for non-programmers. You have to actually get the source and compile some example programs to try out this stuff. (Although I think I\'ll make at least dynamic ambient occlusion available as an easy option inside view3dscene in the future.) The full source code, and example models, are available in SVN, naturally. Simple instructions:</p>

<pre>
$ svn checkout https://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_game_engine/

$ cd kambi_vrml_game_engine/examples/vrml/shadow_fields
$ ./shadow_fields_compile.sh
$ ./shadow_fields

$ cd ../dynamic_ambient_occlusion
$ ./dynamic_ambient_occlusion_compile.sh
$ ./dynamic_ambient_occlusion models/peach.wrl.gz
</pre>

<p>There are more sample models in the <tt>models</tt> subdirectories,
and you can test both demos with your own models.
Both techniques require highly-tesselated
models to make shadows look nice. Shadow fields require preprocessing
by included <tt>precompute_shadow_field</tt> program. Dynamic ambient
occlusion doesn\'t require any preprocessing, but it requires really good
GPU (it does ~thousands of texture fetches per pixel in GLSL fragment shader).
You can find a lot of notes and links in the README files inside the
source directories.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>'),

    and things will work smoothly
    and fast. All collision detection routines will \"see\"
    the most current scene state, which means that you

    <p>I prepared a video showing a simple dynamic world written in X3D and played with view3dscene, see it on the right. The video is only a poor substitute for actually running and playing with this yourself, feeling the smoothness of all editing (the poor framerate of the video is only because of the capturing process...). So after downloading view3dscene, you're welcome to also download this <a href=\"https://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_test_suite/x3d/dynamic_world.x3dv\">demo dynamic_world.x3dv</a> (or just grab it along with the rest of " . news_a_href_page('Kambi VRML test suite', 'kambi_vrml_test_suite') .
    ") and open it. It shows how you can edit the world by KambiScript, how changing transformations works fast, and how it all cooperates with collision detection &mdash; whatever scene you will build, your avatar will move honoring collision detection.

  <li><p>Changing <b><tt>Switch.whichChoice</tt> is greatly optimized</b>.
    Previously this was very costly operation, now it's instantaneous
    (almost no work is required).
    Many other optimizations were done for dynamic worlds, including
    <b>faster <tt>Transform</tt> traversing</b>, faster sensor's enabled switching,
    more reliable starting of time-dependent nodes and many more.

    <p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.de-panther.com/\">De-Panther</a> for
    pushing me to implement a lot of these features!

<p>I implemented a demo of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precomputed_Radiance_Transfer\">Precomputed Radiance Transfer</a> using our engine.</p>

<p>In a few words, this is a technique to make very cool self-shadowing by soft shadows under dynamic lighting. (Actually it's possible to go much further, see the papers about PRT <a href=\"https://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_game_engine/examples/vrml/radiance_transfer/README\">linked from my README</a>). You can see the screenshots on the right: 1st shows normal OpenGL lighting (without PRT), 2nd shows the simple ambient occlusion per-vertex (this is, in some sense, a special case of PRT), and the 3rd screenshot shows PRT technique in all it's glory.</p>

<p>The full source code is available, naturally. Simple instructions:</p>

<pre>
$ svn checkout https://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_game_engine/
$ cd kambi_vrml_game_engine/examples/vrml/radiance_transfer
$ ./radiance_transfer_compile.sh
$ ./radiance_transfer models/chinchilla_with_prt.wrl.gz
</pre>

<p>Inside that directory there are also other models ready to test with
PRT. There's also <tt>precompute_radiance_transfer</tt> to process
any 3D model (readable by my engine &mdash; VRML, X3D, 3DS, Wavefront,
Collada...) into a VRML model that can be displayed using
<tt>radiance_transfer</tt> with PRT effects. There's also <tt>show_sh</tt>
program to view 25 first <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics\">spherical harmonics</a> (this will be useful if you'll want to understand how PRT works :) )."),

  <li><p>Various <b>navigation improvements for scripted worlds</b>:
    <tt>NavigationInfo.type = \"NONE\"</tt> and
    <tt>NavigationInfo.speed = 0</tt> cases are supported.
    They are useful when you implement whole navigation yourself, by <tt>KeySensor</tt>

    <p>Also view3dscene key shortcuts changed, to allow easily avoiding
    collisions with keys that you handle through <tt>KeySensor</tt> and scripting.
    All menu shortcuts are now with <i>Ctrl</i> modifier
    (for example, previously you switched collision detection with <i>C</i>,
    now you have to press <i>Ctrl+C</i>).</li>

<p><i>Plans for the next release</i>: first of all octree updating problems
will be solved.
Right now they are a weak point of our engine &mdash; animating geometry
by VRML events is unnecessarily time-consuming when collision detection has to be up-to-date.
Also more rendering optimizations for animating by VRML events
will be done (optimize case when you often change <tt>Switch</tt>
choice, automatically detect when roSeparateShapeStates /

  <li><p><b>X3D support</b> (both XML and classic encoding).
    Our " . news_a_href_page('VRML implementation status', 'vrml_implementation_status') . "
    page has detailed information about supported features.</p></li>

  <li><p><b>Events mechanism</b> (routes, exposed events, sensors, interpolators etc.)
    is implemented. This allows you to define interactions and animations
    of 3D world within a single VRML/X3D file, as envisioned in
    the specifications.</p>

    <p>Four basic sensors are implemented now: <tt>TimeSensor</tt>,
    <tt>TouchSensor</tt>, <tt>KeySensor</tt> and <tt>ProximitySensor</tt>.
    Also <tt>Anchor</tt> is \"clickable\" now. For now you have to be in
    <tt>Walk</tt> mode with <i>Collision Checking</i>
    enabled to have picking (<tt>TouchSensor</tt>, <tt>Anchor</tt>) working.</p>

    <p>Linear interpolators are also implemented.
    Some \"event utilities\" nodes are implemented
    (including useful <a href=\"http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/kambi_vrml_extensions.php#section_ext_avalon\"><tt>Logger</tt>
    node from Avalon extensions</a>).
    Events to work with bindable nodes (Background, Fog and such) work.
    <a href=\"http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/vrml_implementation_shaders.php\">Routing
    events to GLSL shaders uniform variables works perfectly.</a>.
    Events to control behavior of <tt>Inline</tt> (and <tt>InlineLoadControl</tt>
    for VRML 97) work too.
    Prototypes and external prototypes also work 100% with events according
    to specification, so you can pass events to/from prototypes.
    New " . news_a_href_page('Kambi VRML test suite 2.2.0', 'kambi_vrml_test_suite') . "
    has some simple demos of our events implementation.</p></li>

  <li><p><b>MovieTexture</b> is handled, with very useful <a href=\"http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/kambi_vrml_extensions.php#section_ext_movie_from_image_sequence\">extension
    to load movie from a sequence of images (with possible alpha
    channel)</a>, this is great for pre-rendered animations of flames, smoke etc.
    Normal movie formats are also handled if <a href=\"http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/\">ffmpeg</a>
    is installed and available on \$PATH.</p></li>

  <li><p><b>Recording movies</b> from view3dscene is possible.
    This allows recording 3D animations to a movie file
    (with perfect quality, as opposed to using independent
    programs that capture OpenGL output).</p></li>

      <li>HAnim nodes support.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><p>" . news_a_href_page('"The Castle" 0.8.2', 'castle') . " release also deserves
    mention, as it fixes <b>support for OpenAL Soft</b> implementation
    (available on newer Linux distros).

An extremely important feature of VRML / X3D is finally implemented:
routes and events mechanism works. This means that you can express animations and interactions
within single VRML / X3D file, like envisioned in the specifications.</p>

<p>We have 2 sensor nodes working already (<tt>TimeSensor</tt>

nodes (including <a href=\"http://instant-reality.com/documentation/nodetype/Logger/\">Avalon
<tt>Logger</tt> node</a>, a useful debugger for events).
All exposed fields of other nodes also work, obviously.
This is all available only in SVN for now. When I get back from vacation
(at the end of August) this work will be continued (many other sensors
are easy to implement now, and some existing code should be cleaned and
optimized) and it will all be released as <i>view3dscene 3.0</i>.</p>

(see " . news_a_href_page('changes_log', 'news') . " for a full list of changes) :</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href=\"http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/kambi_vrml_extensions.php#ext_bump_mapping\">Bump
    mapping</a>. Various bump mapping methods are implemented,
    the most advanced being steep parallax mapping with self-shadowing.</li>

  <li>Shaders support, including <a href=\"http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/kambi_vrml_extensions.php#ext_shaders\">specifying GLSL
    shaders in VRML</a>. Programmers may easily initialize
    GLSL and ARB assembly shaders.</li>

  <li>Anti-aliasing available in both "
    . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . "
    and " . news_a_href_page('castle', 'castle') . ".</li>

  <li>Collada model format basic support (1.3.x and 1.4.x)
    added to the engine, you can also convert Collada files to VRML 2.0.</li>

  <li><i>Examine</i> mode allows to rotate and move the scene by mouse
    dragging.</li>

  <li><tt>--screenshot</tt> command-line option for
    " . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . ",
    to take screenshots of the scene in batch mode.</li>

  <li>" . news_a_href_page('Our Blender VRML 97 exporter script', 'blender_stuff') . "
    improved: <i>set solid / set smooth / autosmooth / autosmooth degrees</i>
    settings from Blender are correctly exported to VRML.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other releases:
" . news_a_href_page('Kambi VRML test suite 2.1.0', 'kambi_vrml_test_suite') . "
has many new tests/demos for new features (bump mapping, GLSL,
Collada format). Also released most other programs,
to bring them up-to-date with current engine state.</p>
",
          'description' =>

"<p>Released " . news_a_href_page('engine version 1.3.0', 'kambi_vrml_game_engine') . ",
" . news_a_href_page('view3dscene 2.4.0', 'view3dscene') . " and
" . news_a_href_page('castle 0.8.1', 'castle') . ".
Many long-awaited graphic features implemented:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>Bump mapping</b>: <a href=\"http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/kambi_vrml_extensions.php#ext_bump_mapping\">VRML
    renderer allows bump mapping</a>. Various bump mapping methods
    are implemented (best method is auto-detected and used at runtime):
    dot by multitexturing (not normalized and normalized by cube map),
    dot by GLSL (optionally with parallax mapping, optionally with
    steep parallax mapping and self-shadowing).</p>

    <p>" . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . " allows to easily
    turn on bump mapping, assuming model specifies normal maps.<br/>
    " . news_a_href_page('castle', 'castle') . " uses bump mapping, for now only
    on the \"fountain\" level.</p>

    <p><i>For programmers</i>: see also <tt>kambi_vrml_game_engine/examples/vrml/bump_mapping</tt> demo in engine sources,
    it demonstrates emboss, dot and all other bump mapping
    methods built in VRML engine. Also my notes about emboss and dot
    (by multitexturing) bump mapping methods may be interesting:
    see <a href=\"http://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_game_engine/examples/vrml/bump_mapping/README\">bump_mapping/README</a>.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p><b>GLSL shaders support:</b> engine supports easily using
    ARB vertex / fragment programs (assembly shaders) and&nbsp;GLSL.</p>

    <p>You can also <a href=\"http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/kambi_vrml_extensions.php#ext_shaders\">directly
    specify GLSL shaders inside VRML file</a>, which is a great feature
    for VRML authors. Syntax of shaders in VRML follows X3D specification.</p>

    <p>" . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . " allows to control
    GLSL shaders and even simply assign GLSL shaders
    (check out <i>Edit -&gt; Simply assign GLSL shader to all objects</i>
    menu item), so you can test your shaders with any 3D model.</p>

    <p><i>For programmers</i>: you may find useful my notes about shading languages in
    <a href=\"http://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/vrmlengine/trunk/kambi_vrml_game_engine/opengl/examples/shading_langs/README\">shading_langs_demo/README</a>.</p>

  <li><p><b>Anti-aliasing</b> available (if multisampling is supported by
    graphic card). " . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . "
    has comfortable menu <i>File -&gt; Startup Preferences -&gt; Anti aliasing</i>
    and also a command-line option <tt>--anti-alias</tt> to control this,
    " . news_a_href_page('castle', 'castle') . " has comfortable menu item
    in <i>Video options</i>.</p>

  <li><p><b>Collada model format</b> basic support (1.3.x and 1.4.x)
    added to the engine (" . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . "
    and everything else open Collada files, just like any other model format;
    you can also convert Collada files to VRML 2.0).</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Wavefront OBJ format handling improved (we handle normal vectors,
    materials, textures).</p>
  </li>

  <li><p><tt>Examine</tt> mode allows to rotate and move the scene by mouse
    dragging. This is more intuitive and sometimes comfortable.
    This feature is mostly noticeable in
    " . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . ", although
    some example programs in engine demos also use such examine mode
    and also benefit from this.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Besides improvements above, some improvements specific to
" . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . ":</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>--screenshot</tt> command-line option, requested a few times,
    to take screenshots of the scene in batch mode.</li>
  <li>Various <i>fill modes</i>. Previously only <i>normal</i> and
    <i>wireframe</i> were available, now we have a couple more,
    like solid wireframe and silhouette. Keys changed (\"w\" key no longer works,
    \"f\" key changes fill mode instead of fog state).</li>
</ul>

<p>Also " . news_a_href_page('our Blender VRML 97 exporter script', 'blender_stuff') . "
improved: <i>set solid / set smooth / autosmooth / autosmooth degrees</i>
settings from Blender are correctly exported to VRML file (as creasteAngle field).</p>

<p>Other most notable internal engine changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I dropped my custom OpenGLh binding in favor of using GL, GLU, GLExt units
    from FPC. <i>Full story:</i> OpenGLh was developed when FPC had no usable OpenGL binding unit
    (neither had Delphi)... Times have changed, and current GL, GLU, GLExt
    units are usable, and (partially thanks
    <a href=\"http://www.mail-archive.com/fpc-devel@lists.freepascal.org/msg02328.html\">to</a>
    <a href=\"http://www.freepascal.org/mantis/view.php?id=7570\">my</a>
    <a href=\"http://www.freepascal.org/mantis/view.php?id=7600\">patches</a>,
    <a href=\"http://bugs.freepascal.org/view.php?id=10460\">quite</a>
    <a href=\"http://bugs.freepascal.org/view.php?id=10507\">a</a>
    <a href=\"http://bugs.freepascal.org/view.php?id=10508\">few</a> :) )
    they work good and support OpenGL 2.0 functions.
    (While OpenGLh was on the level of GL 1.2 + many extensions).</li>

  <li>Among many new demo programs, there's also
    <tt>kambi_vrml_game_engine/examples/vrml/plane_mirror_and_shadow.lpr</tt>
    to test plane-projected shadows and plane mirrors. Plane-projected shadows
    is only for simple demo (we have implemented shadow volumes, thousand times better
    algorithm, after all), but plane mirrors will be implemented
    in the future in the VRML engine (using \"mirror\" <tt>Material</tt>
    field automatically).</li>
</ul>

<p>Other releases:
" . news_a_href_page('Kambi VRML test suite 2.1.0', 'kambi_vrml_test_suite') . "

Collada format). Also released:

    about shadows implementation.</a></li>
</ul>",
          'description' =>

"<p>" . news_a_href_page('"The Castle" 0.8.0', 'castle') . " released:

<ul>
  <li><p>New demo level: <i>the fountain</i>, done in pure VRML 2.0
    format (no more VRML 1.0). Shadows for whole level are generated dynamically.
    In the next release, this level is supposed to be augmented with some
    eye candy graphical effects, for now enjoy VRML 2.0 and shadows :)</p></li>

  <li><p>Shadows improvements (see also
    <a href=\"http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/vrml_engine_doc/output/xsl/html/chapter.shadows.html\">new chapter
    in documentation about shadows</a>) :</p>

    <ul>
      <li>First of all, z-fail implemented and proper detection when z-fail
        is needed implemented, so faster z-pass is used when possible.
        \"The Castle\" shows (toggle with Tab, just like for FPS) number
        of shadows qualified as z-pass, z-fail, z-fail with light cap needed etc.
      <li>Shadow volumes silhouette optimization improved: now models don't have
        to be perfect manifold to use this. See
        <tt>kambi_vrml_game_engine/examples/vrml/shadow_volume_test/</tt>
        demo, in particular the <tt>shadow_volume_test_ball_with_tentacles.sh</tt>
        example.</li>
      <li>Much better frustum culling for shadows.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><p>Arrows are affected by gravity, and underwater \"sick\" projection
    effect, thanks to Grzegorz Hermanowicz (herrmannek).</li>

  <li><p>Numerous memory and speed optimizations to load VRML models and
    animations faster and better (thanks to valgrind (callgrind, massif)).
    Also in \"The Castle\" there's new <i>Conserve memory</i> feature
    (this basically means that only creature animations needed for current
    level are kept in memory), turned on by default.</p>

    <p>So \"Loading creatures\" is much less resource consuming.
    And finally pretty much all Radeon issues are fixed now.</li>

  <li>Fixed hang (actually, a really really long delay) when closing sound device
    on Linux (actually, with OpenAL sample implementation).</li>

  <li>Demo levels are available directly from \"New game\" menu now.</li>
  <li>Nicer credits screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>" . news_a_href_page('view3dscene 2.3.0', 'view3dscene') . " released:

<ul>
  <li>Prototypes (both <tt>PROTO</tt> and <tt>EXTERNPROTO</tt>)
    VRML 2.0 feature is fully implemented now !</li>
  <li>VRML 2.0 lights are correctly handled (<tt>DirectionalLight</tt>
    affects every sibling, positional lights affect whole scene taking
    <tt>radius</tt> into account).</li>
  <li><tt>ROUTE</tt> constructs of VRML 2.0 are parsed now.
    Although they still don't actually <b>do</b> anything.
    So at least scenes using routes are partially handled (routes are simply
    ignored), instead of just producing an error.</li>
  <li>Default blending dest factor for view3dscene is
    <tt>GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA</tt>, since this is expected by most VRML
    authors.</li>
  <li>VRML files compressed by gzip are handled OK even if they have
    normal <tt>.wrl</tt> extension.</li>
  <li>--write-to-vrml fixed</li>
  <li>Handling of colors (<tt>color</tt>, <tt>colorPerVertex</tt>,
    <tt>colorIndex</tt>) for <tt>IndexedFaceSet</tt> and <tt>IndexedLineSet</tt>
    done.</li>
  <li>NavigationInfo.speed is now handled correctly (it sets speed per second)</li>
  <li><a
    href=\"http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/kambi_vrml_extensions.php#ext_text3d\">Text3D extension</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>" . news_a_href_page('Kambi VRML game engine 1.2.0', 'kambi_vrml_game_engine') . "
released. Most features mentioned above for view3dscene and castle
(shadows, optimizations, all VRML 2.0 features) are actually implemented
in the engine, and other programs only use them. Additionally, some
more internal features not mentioned above:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Engine is ported and works flawlessly on x86-64 on Linux.
    No more only 32-bit :) Also, it's partially ported to Windows x84-64
    (tested compilation with cross compiler, no actual run tests).</p>

    <p>This also results in the change of archive binary names:
    they all get <tt>i386</tt> after their name, eventually I may release
    precompiled versions for <tt>x86-64</tt> too.</p></li>

  <li><p>GLWindow allows to change cursor shape.</p></li>

  <li><p>Everything is compiled using new FPC 2.2.0.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>" . news_a_href_page('Kambi VRML test suite 2.0.0', 'kambi_vrml_test_suite') . "
released: many new tests to test new features (protos, external protos,
colors, light scope, running path to test NavigationInfo.speed, 3d text),
some important VRML 1.0 tests ported to VRML 2.0 too (castle,
relative_names, texture_test, house behind the glass).</p>

    They are available only from SVN sources for now:
    sandbox (a demo of isometric rendering) and "The Rift" (my current small
    project &mdash; a demo in the style of adventure games, with still background
    and 3d players; just a start for now).</p>

    link to "Teaching" stuff at the top of the main page).
    Besides, well, life has been really good lately &mdash; thanks to K.O.
    and the mountains. :)

    <p>"The Castle" user-visible features:
    <ul>
      <li><b>New DOOM E1M1 level.</b>
      <li><b>Ported to Mac OS X.</b>
      <li><b>Shadows much improved.</b> Not totally finished yet
        (still only depth-pass),
        but much corrected and optimized. With good graphic card, the game is
        playable with shadows on. <i>Thanks go to Olgierd Humeczuk for setting
        me on the right track.</i>
      <li>New controls features:
        <ul>
          <li>You can assign up to two keys and one mouse button for
            each action in "The Castle".
          <li>Default shortcuts changed to more resemble modern FPS games:
            use AWSD moving, left/right arrows rotate,
            E interacts (HalfLife2-like), R drops etc.
          <li>New keybinding to use "potion of life" if owned,
            <!-- (analogy of "m" for "medkit" in tremulous)-->
            default is "l" (lower "L").
            Very handy in the middle of the fight, when you really don\'t have time
            to search your inventory by the "[", "]" keys .
          <li>"Invert vertical mouse look" option.
        </ul>
      <li><tt>--screen-size</tt> command-line option.
      <li>On "Castle Hall" level: werewolves fight totally changed, to be much more
        interesting.
      <li>On "The Gate" level: teleport made closer, to reduce a little the need
        for jumping, scroll of flying easier to get with sword, doors at the end,
        minor fixes.
      <li>Footsteps sound now changes within level, depending on whether you
        walk on grass or concrete ground.
      <li>Much better demo (background behing main menu). Enjoy.
      <li>Alien model improved (better animation, manifold (for shadows),
        skin texture with ambient occlusion).
    </ul>

    view3dscene user-visible features:
    <ul>
      <li><b>MD3 (Quake3 engine) model format fully supported.</b>
      <li>Radio menu items in view3dscene.
      <li>Ability to select an item (point and it\'s triangle).
      <li>Edit menu items to remove selected geometry node and selected face.
      <li>Recently opened files menu.
      <li>In MouseLook mode, right/left keys work like strafe
        and comma/dot are for rotations.
      <li>Changing blending source and dest factors at runtime.
      <li>Menu item to show OpenGL capabilities.
      <li>Also ported to Mac OS X, actually the whole engine is ported to Mac OS X.
    </ul>

    <p>Most notable bugfixes:
    <ul>
      <li>Various problems specific to particular OpenGL implementations fixed:
        <ul>
          <li>Radeon: wire box is now drawn correctly.
          <li>Mesa, Radeon: volumetric fog rendering fixed.
          <li>Other small fixes for Mesa.
          <li>Some NVidia cards: life indicator alpha rendering fixed.
          <!-- li><b>Not all Radeon bugs are fixed yet, but they are planned to be
            fixed for the next release.</b -->
        </ul>
      <li>Libpng under Unixes loading fix (no longer need to install
        libpng*-dev packages).
    </ul>

    <p>Most notable engine internal improvements for programmers
    (of course not counting features and fixes that already got mentioned above... ) :
    <ul>
      <li>VRML camera is now correctly read, transformation of <tt>Viewpoint</tt>
        indicates gravity direction. This way you can set gravity up vector
        and initial camera up vector to different things.
      <li>New examples in "Kambi VRML game engine":<br />
        <tt>vrml/opengl/examples/shadow_volume_test</tt>,<br />
        <tt>opengl/examples/demo_matrix_navigation</tt>,<br />
        <tt>3d/examples/draw_space_filling_curve</tt>,<br />
        <tt>opengl/examples/fog_coord</tt>,<br />
        <tt>audio/examples/algets</tt> and<br />
        <tt>audio/examples/alplay</tt>.
      <li>Everything is in FPC objfpc mode, no longer Delphi compat mode anywhere.
      <li>Integration with FPC Matrix unit started (VectorMath now reuses
        non-object types from Matrix, many units use Matrix object types
        and overloaded operators).
      <li><tt>VRMLRayTracer</tt> interface changed to much cleaner object-oriented.
      <li>Detailed GL_VERSION and GLU_VERSION parsing and reporting,
        including the ability to detect Mesa and Mesa version.
        See GLVersion and GLUVersion objects.
      <li>"The Castle" excellent level objects framework: things that move and animate
        on the level are now much easier to add and design. This was already heavily
        used by DOOM E1M1 level, also see the nice elevator demo on "Tower" level.
      <li>TVRMLGLAnimation updated to work with VRML 2.0 SFNode and MFNode fields.
      <li>OggVorbis loading and playing (through OpenAL extension
        or vorbisfile library).
    </ul>

    <p>"The Castle" improvements for content (e.g. 3D level) designers.
    Many "The Castle" debug menu improvements and greatly improved game
    confugurability by editing game XML files:
    <ul>
      <!--li>"Render for level screenshot"-->
      <li>Configure sounds by <tt>sounds/index.xml</tt> file,
        debug menu option "Reload sounds.xml".
      <li>Configure items by <tt>items/kinds.xml</tt> file.
      <li>Blending type configurable for all items and creatures.
      <li>All animations are now expressed in external files
        (in *.kanim files or in XML nodes inside kinds.xml files).
      <!--li>"Fly" debug option.-->
      <li>Configure levels by <tt>levels/index.xml</tt> file.
        Many level properties, also hint boxes are configurable there.
      <li>New level "hello world".
      <li><tt>KambiHeadLight</tt> node to configure headlight from VRML.
      <li>No longer any need for "Transparent" properties. All creatures/items/levels
        can now freely mix transparent and opaque parts, and everything will
        be rendered always OK.
      <li>Octree params configurable from debug menu.
    </ul>

    <p>Also packaging changes: <tt>units-src</tt> renamed to
    <tt>kambi_vrml_game_engine-src</tt>,
    <tt>kambi.cfg</tt> file is included inside, <tt>test_kambi_units</tt>
    is included inside. Most programs package names include their version numbers.

    <p>Minor programs releases:
    ' . news_a_href_page('rayhunter 1.2.1', 'rayhunter') . ',
    ' . news_a_href_page('lets_take_a_walk 1.2.0', 'lets_take_a_walk') . ',

  <div class="old_news_item"><p><span class="old_news_date">February 28, 2007:</span>
    <p>Hello! It\'s been a while without any significant update on this page &mdash;
    so I thought that I just let you all know that the work on
     ' . news_a_href_page('"The Castle"', 'castle') . ' and
     ' . news_a_href_page('Kambi VRML game engine', 'kambi_vrml_game_engine') . '
     was ongoing in these last months.
    0.7.0 release of "The Castle", 2.1.0 release of view3dscene along
    with releases of most other programs on this page are scheduled
    within a week or two. A lot of internal features (usable for programmers
    wanting to use my engine, or 3D content designers for "The Castle") were done,
    along with a lot of bugfixes and many small feature additions.</p></div>

  <div class="old_news_item"><p><span class="old_news_date">October 7, 2006:</span>
    <p>Good news for FreeBSD users: I finally upgraded my FreeBSD to 6.1,
    and got NVidia OpenGL working smoothly there, along with OpenAL.
    So I updated all FreeBSD binaries on these pages to their latest version.
    I also confirmed that ' . news_a_href_page('"The Castle"', 'castle') . '
     compiles and works perfectly under FreeBSD (although the FreeBSD binary
    is not included in the game archive yet).</div>

  <div class="old_news_item"><p><span class="old_news_date">October 1, 2006:</span>
    <p>A made a new page about my
    ' . news_a_href_page('Kambi VRML game engine', 'kambi_vrml_game_engine') . '.
     Most of the content of this page was already said here and there,
    but now I want to say it more explicitly: <em>I\'m making a reusable game
    engine</em>. Also the engine sources are updated now, three new example
    programs are added: <tt>images/examples/image_convert</tt>,
    <tt>opengl/examples/test_font_break</tt> and
    <tt>opengl/examples/multi_glwindow</tt>.</div>

  <div class="old_news_item"><p><span class="old_news_date">September 27, 2006:</span>
    <p>Final version of
    ' . news_a_href_page("my master's thesis about my VRML engine",
      'vrml_engine_doc') . ' is available now.</p></div>

  <div class="old_news_item"><p><span class="old_news_date">September 21, 2006:</span>

    <p>Newest version of
    ' . news_a_href_page("my master's thesis about my VRML engine",
      'vrml_engine_doc') . ' is available. Only the 7th chapter remains
    undone. <em>Later update the same day: all chapters done!</em></p>

    <p>Units ' . news_a_href_page('sources', 'sources') . ' updated:
    included is an example how to do fog culling (to the fog visibility range),
    see the file <tt>units/vrml/opengl/examples/fog_culling.dpr</tt>.
    Also blending source and dest factors are now configurable.
    Also behavior on incorrect <tt>Background</tt> nodes is now better
    (reports warning and proceeds).</p></div>

  <div class="old_news_item"><p><span class="old_news_date">September 13, 2006:</span>

    <p>First of all, a draft and unfinished version of
    ' . news_a_href_page("my master's thesis about my VRML engine",
    'vrml_engine_doc') . ' is available.</p>

    <p>' . news_a_href_page('view3dscene 2.0.1', 'view3dscene') . '
     released &mdash; small updates and fixes. New menu items
    were added to display the whole octree and to change the
    point size of <tt>PointSet</tt>.
    The quadric stacks value (for the command-line option
    <tt>--detail-quadric-stacks</tt>
    and <tt>KambiTriangulation</tt> node) can be 1 now.
    The recently released FPC 2.0.4 is used to compile view3dscene now.</p>

    <p>Also, <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/view3dscene/">view3dscene
    entry was added to freshmeat</a>. You can use this e.g. to subscribe to new
    releases, so that you will be automatically notified about new
    releases of view3dscene.</p>

    <p>In ' . news_a_href_page('VRML test suite',
      'kambi_vrml_test_suite') . '
     <tt>vrml_2/kambi_extensions/fog_linear_with_immune.wrl</tt> test fixed.</div>

  <div class="old_news_item"><p><span class="old_news_date">August 24, 2006:</span>

    <p>First of all, I\'m proud to announce that
    <b>VRML 2.0 (aka VRML 97) support is implemented now</b>.
    It\'s by no means complete yet, but it\'s definitely usable
    already &mdash; see ' . news_a_href_page('VRML implementation status',
    'vrml_implementation_status') . ' for details and results of
    various test suites. Almost all of my
    ' . news_a_href_page("non-standard VRML extensions",
      "kambi_vrml_extensions") . ' work in VRML 2.0 too, and actually
    you can even ' . news_a_href_page_hashlink(
      "mix VRML 1.0 and 2.0 features in your files",
      "kambi_vrml_extensions", 'section_ext_mix_vrml_1_2') . '.

    <ul>
      <li>' . news_a_href_page('view3dscene 2.0.0', 'view3dscene') . '
        released &mdash; VRML 2.0 suppport,
        various other improvements: "Jump to viewpoint" menu added
        (this is useful both for VRML 2.0 Viewpoint nodes and VRML 1.0
        cameras too), --camera-pos, --camera-dir, --camera-up,
        --camera-up-z, --camera-kind, --view-angle-x command-line options
        removed (all these properties (and much more) can be set now
        by appropriate Viewpoint/camera nodes in the file; I decided that
        keeping these options was an unnecessary complication of implementation),
        menu disabling implemented, warnings while loading VRML file are
        stored and can be later viewed from the GUI using "View warnings"
        menu item, added "Reopen" menu item, added "Edit" menu
        (to perform interactively all the things previously
        controlled by <tt>--scene-change-*</tt> command-line options;
        <tt>--scene-change-*</tt> command-line options remain to work
        but only for the first loaded scene, so they are mostly useful
        when combined with <tt>--write-to-vrml</tt>).
      <li>' . news_a_href_page('Kambi VRML test suite',
        'kambi_vrml_test_suite') . ' &mdash; this was previously
        known on these pages as "kambi_vrml_examples.tar.gz", or "Example VRMLs".
        Many test cases were added
        for VRML 2.0, some of which were translated from VRML 1.0,
        some are new, some are created with Blender\'s VRML 97
        exporter. These VRML files are now officially licensed on GNU GPL.
      <li>' . news_a_href_page('rayhunter 1.2.0', 'rayhunter') . '
        released &mdash; VRML 2.0 support.
      <li>' . news_a_href_page('rayhunter gallery', 'raytr_gallery') . ' &mdash;
        added <i>mirror fun</i> rendering, demonstrating mirror effect
        in one of the first rayhunter renderings of VRML 2.0 model.
      <li>' . news_a_href_page('"The Castle" 0.6.6', 'castle') . '
        released &mdash; in 0.6.5 sky on the "Gate" level
        was not visible, fixed now. Also suppport for designing levels
        in VRML 2.0 added, but not finished yet, see TODO item on
        ' . news_a_href_page('"The Castle" &mdash; development',
        'castle-development') . ' page.
      <li>' . news_a_href_page('glViewImage 1.2.0', 'glviewimage') . '
        released,
        ' . news_a_href_page('glplotter 1.1.5', 'glplotter_and_gen_function') . ' released,
        ' . news_a_href_page('bezier_curves 1.1.4', 'bezier_curves') . ' released
         &mdash; updated to inherit many improvements in
        OpenGL and images units: menu disabling,
        and GIF images reading (by running ImageMagick under the hood),
        fixed handling of PNG files with alpha channel recorded in tRNS chunk.
      <li>' . news_a_href_page('lets_take_a_walk 1.1.5', 'lets_take_a_walk') . '
        released,
        ' . news_a_href_page('malfunction 1.2.2', 'malfunction') . '
        released
         &mdash; small fixes and generally updated
        to compile with latest version of VRML units.
      <li>' . news_a_href_page('Sources', 'sources') . ' and
        ' . news_a_href_page('sources documentation', 'reference') . '
        updated with all improvements mentioned above.
      <li><tt>edytorek</tt> is removed from these pages.
        Reasoning: I was not using it, not developing it, and I lost my interest
        in it long time ago. Since a long time I use Emacs as my only
        text editor, under all OSes. So there were a couple of embarassing
        issues with <tt>edytorek</tt> : it was Windows-only, it was
        compiled with Delphi Personal, and I didn\'t publish here it\'s source code...
        All these issues are quite embarassing for someone who
        uses Linux and FreePascal as his main work tools, and develops
        open-source programs... Of course I intended to clean edytorek
        code, porting it to Lazarus and publish it\'s sources some day,
        but, honestly, I don\'t think that it will ever happen.
        So, goodbye <tt>edytorek</tt>.
    </ul>
    </div>

  <div class="old_news_item"><p><span class="old_news_date">August 1, 2006:</span>
    <p>New version of ' . news_a_href_page('"The Castle"', "castle") . '
     (0.6.5) released: whole documentation is in HTML (available
    both here online and offline inside <tt>documentation/</tt>
    subdirectory, README file inside archive doesn\'t contain much now),
    <tt>--debug-log</tt> option will print lots of debug info,
    lifeloss when falling down lowered (to avoid getting hurt too easily
    when jumping), removed one scroll of flying from "Castle Hall"
    (to make the trick with flying over creatures harder),
    many other small changes and fixes.

    <p><i>My nearest development plans</i>:
    <ul>
      <li>At the end of this week I plan to finally
        upload here basic (static, without any PROTOs) VRML 97 support
        for ' . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . ' !

      <li>Unfortunately further "The Castle" development is going to be suspended
        until the end of September. At the end of September I should do to
        "The Castle" two things: 1. add a small joke/experiment level
        (it\'s already partially done &mdash; you\'ll see what is this :) and
        2. finally fix these Radeon issues. This will result in 0.7.0 release.
        So stay tuned.

  <div class="old_news_item"><span class="old_news_date">May 19, 2006:</span>
    <p>New version of ' . news_a_href_page('"The Castle"', 'castle') . ' (0.6.3)
    released. Various "cleaning" changes and fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>Memory use reduced, this also reduced loading time.

        <p><i>Comparison:</i>
        Times and memory use below were measured on Linux with release build,
        with NVidia drivers. Note that the actual times and memory use may vary
        wildly from one graphic driver to the other, as the most time and memory
        consuming tasks are in preparing OpenGL things, like display lists
        and textures. For example, on Windows, memory consumption is slightly
        lower, which indicates that NVidia drivers are slightly better optimized
        for memory use on Windows.
        But hopefully the proportions will be around the same.
        Times below were measured for entering "New Game" -> "The Gate" level.

    <pre>
    0.6.2 version times:
      Loading level: 10 sec
      Loading creatures: 41 sec
      Loading items: ~ 4 sec

        A lot of improvements to how we store and generate TVRMLGLAnimation
        instances was done for this.

      <li>"Debug menu" is now separated from normal game menu,
        is invoked by ~ key, default FPS toggle key is Tab now.
        This is all to make debug menu (a little) more hidden.
        Also debug menu has now submenus for commands related to:
        player, creatures and items. Added commands "Set Player.MaxLife"
        and "Reload animations/models of specific item".

      <li>Error messages fixed on Linux, previously various errors
        (e.g. in level or creatures VRML models) produced
        "ModeGLEnter cannot be called on a closed GLWindow" message
        instead of the right message.

      <li>--display command-line option for XWindows (but is sometimes
        unstable, probably because of NVidia OpenGL unstabilities)

      <li>Applied patches from Szymon Stoma &amp; Kaka Zaremba to improve
        texturing of some places on "The Gate".

      <li>MouseLook can be turned off.

      <li>Proper texture filtering is used for items, creatures and all level
        parts. Previously items, creatures and StairsBlocker on castle_hall
        used bad filtering (always GL_LINEAR, while e.g. GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR
        was noticeably better; in general, "Video options -> Texture quality"
        setting should be used).
    </ul>

    <p>Also ' . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . ' (version 1.2.4)
    released: mouse look available (use "m" key). Just like in "The Castle".

    <p>New version of ' . news_a_href_page('"The Castle"', 'castle') . ' (0.6.2)
    released. Changes from version 0.6.0 include:
    right mouse button now does jumping, sound of SpiderQueen hurt fixed,
    SpiderQueen adjusted &mdash; overall it\'s a little easier to defeat now,
    although some details make it also harder (life decreased,
    the trick with jumping/flying on SpiderQueen is now much harder),
    bow + arrows added, Werewolf has higher life now.
    This was all done for version 0.6.1, that was final version for PGD
    competition. Version 0.6.2 brings only minor corrections to README and
    "Credits" text.</div>

    features are: new level "Cages" with new creatures,
    much reworked level "The Gate" (thanks to Szymon Stoma and Kaka Zaremba),
    new features making creatures harder to beat
    (homing missiles, knockback for player, now so easy to interrupt boss
    attack, aliens try to always stay away from you,
    most creatures are generally faster), life indicator for bosses,
    and an ending sequence is done.

    <p>Also ' . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . ' (version 1.2.3)

    <ul>
      <li>First of all, ' . news_a_href_page('a preview of my new game "The Castle" is available',
        'castle') . '. This is the project that I am working on since February
        this year. Everyone is most welcome to download and try it !

      <li><p>Updated ' . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . '
        (ver 1.2.2):

        <p>VRML extensions:
        <ul>
          <li>' . news_a_href_page_hashlink(
            'Field <tt>separate</tt> for <tt>WWWInline</tt> node',
            'kambi_vrml_extensions', 'section_ext_wwwinline_separate') . '.
          <li>' . news_a_href_page_hashlink(
            '<tt>Fog</tt> node extensions to define volumetric fog',

            '<tt>fogImmune</tt> field for <tt>Material</tt> node',
            'kambi_vrml_extensions', 'section_ext_fog_immune') . '
        </ul>

        <p>Also head bobbing much better, and various other improvements.

      <li><p>Important updates to demo_animation
        (see <tt>units/vrml/opengl/examples/</tt>) in the
        ' . news_a_href_page('sources', 'sources') . ':
        <ul>
          <li>New demo (gus) showing how to use Blender "armature" animation
            to export animation to VRMLs such that demo_animation is able to
            render it. This is quite great, because this allows you to very
            comfortably design animations in Blender and then use them with my engine.
          <li>Important fix for animating models with textures, demo (cube_opening)
            added.
          <li>Animating class <tt>TVRMLGLAnimation</tt> extended to be able
            to animate / morph between an atritrary number of models (>= 2),
            not only 2. Each model has an associated point of time in the
            animation. Demo (gus_3_final, to be used together with gus_1_final
            and gus_2_final) added.
          <li>Automatic looping and going backwards ability for TVRMLGLAnimation.
            See --loop, --no-loop, --backwards and --no-backwards command-line
            options for demo_animation.
        </ul>

      <li><p>Updated glViewImage (ver 1.1.5) (various small fixes).

      <li><p>Updated many other programs sources to keep them compileable,
        because of many changes in units, and some other various
        small fixes.

      <li><p>Oh, and I put here my
        <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/~michalis/michalis-gpg-public-key.asc">public GPG key</a>.
    </ul>
    </div>

  <div class="old_news_item"><span class="old_news_date">March 9, 2006</span><br>
    Many ' . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . ' (ver 1.2.1)
    updates:
    <ul>
      <li>VRML 97 nodes
        ' . news_a_href_page_hashlink('NavigationInfo',
        'kambi_vrml_extensions', 'section_ext_navigationinfo') . ' and
        ' . news_a_href_page_hashlink('WorldInfo',
        'kambi_vrml_extensions', 'section_ext_worldinfo') . ' handling,
        ' . news_a_href_page('kambi_vrml_test_suite',
        'kambi_vrml_test_suite') . ' has test VRMLs for this.

      <li>More work on gravity stuff: growing up to camera height
        (allows climbing stairs etc.), nice effect when falling down from high,
        jumping ("A" key), crouching ("Z" key), head bobbing.
        Strafe move keys changed (to not collide with "Z" and to be
        more standard): "Comma" / "Period". Also horizontal moving
        in Walk mode is now better (moving dir is not affected by PageUp/PageDown
        keys operations, i.e. current vertical rotation). And vertical rotations
        (PageUp/PageDown keys) are bounded, so that you\'re no longer able to "stand
        on your own head".

      <li><i>Console</i> -> <i>Print scene bounding box as VRML node</i> menu
        command.
    </ul>

    <p>See also screenshots of my game "The Castle" (<i>link not available
    anymore</i>).
    This is the main thing that I\'m working on right now, it\'s for the
    <a href="http://pascalgamedevelopment.com/">PascalGameDevelopment</a>
    competition.

  <div class="old_news_item"><span class="old_news_date">February 24, 2006</span><br>
    Many updates. Every OpenGL based program updated,
    ' . news_a_href_page('all units and programs sources', 'sources') . '
    updated (along with ' . news_a_href_page('their documentation', 'reference') . ').
    Most important things are
    <ul>
      <li>Timing bug fixed in every OpenGL program
      <li>Compilation of many examples fixed
      <li>"Sunny day" level of
        ' . news_a_href_page('malfunction', 'malfunction') . '
        completely reworked and improved
      <li>' . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . '
        up/down navigation improved and "gravity" setting added
    </ul>

    <p>Detailed changes log follows:

    <p>General updates:
    <ul>
      <li>Timing bug fixed (timing was sometimes incorrect, which
        caused some bad artifacts when moving camera or doing some
        animations &mdash; this was particularly observed with newest
        NVidia Linux OpenGL drivers).
      <li>Compilation of many examples fixed; sorry, I wasn\'t compiling examples
        too often and recently I broke many of them (bacause of changes to
        <a href="' . CURRENT_URL . 'apidoc/html/KambiUtils.html#Parameters">Parameters</a>
        stuff). It\'s fixed now. I also added the automatic test of compilation
        to the script I use to create <tt>units-src.tar.gz</tt> archive, so
        this Will Not Happen Again.
      <li>Fullscreen toggle shortcut is F11 (following (GNOME) standards
        &mdash; epiphany, GIMP, gthumb and firefox).
      <li><a href="http://www.freepascal.org/bugs/showrec.php3?ID=4831">FPC 2.0.2 bug #4831</a>
        workarounded (this caused some rare problems when displaying dialog boxes).
    </ul>

    <p>' . news_a_href_page('malfunction', 'malfunction') . ' (ver 1.2.0)
    specific updates:
    <ul>
      <li>"Sunny day" level completely reworked and improved.
      <li>malfunction sources contain now Blender files used to create all
        objects and levels, see devel_data/ subdirectory.
    </ul>

    <p>' . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . ' (ver 1.2.0)
    specific updates:
    <ul>
      <li>Small interface improvements: +/- keys (move speed change) work
        now better (time-based), progress bar is shown in OpenGL window
        when opening scene using "Open" menu item,
        Cancel key for raytracer dialog, "Navigation" submenu.
      <li>Fixed bug that occured for specific models with empty Coordinate3 node
        followed by empty IndexedFaceSet node &mdash; this triggered OpenGL
        error "invalid value" in some cases, now it doesn\'t.
      <li>Better Insert/Delete navigation (vertical moving with respect
        to home camera up, instead of current camera up) in Walk mode.
        ' . news_a_href_page('lets_take_a_walk', 'lets_take_a_walk') . '
        also benefits from this.
      <li>Gravity setting: you can now turn gravity on, and fall down.
        Basic implementation committed, expect more work on this soon
        (including "jump" and "duck" keys and head "bobbing") &mdash; I\'m porting
        stuff from some very old game of mine into
        <a href="' . CURRENT_URL . 'apidoc/html/MatrixNavigation.TMatrixWalker.html">TMatrixWalker</a>
        class.
    </ul>

    <p>' . news_a_href_page('glViewImage', 'glviewimage') . ' (ver 1.1.4)
    small improvement (accepts dir name on command-line).

    <p>Other OpenGL programs updated:
    ' . news_a_href_page('lets_take_a_walk', 'lets_take_a_walk') . ' (ver 1.1.3),
    ' . news_a_href_page('glplotter', 'glplotter_and_gen_function') . ' (ver 1.1.3),
    ' . news_a_href_page('bezier_curves', 'bezier_curves') . ' (ver 1.1.3),
    ' . news_a_href_page('kambi_lines', 'kambi_lines') . ' (ver 1.1.1).
    Also ' . news_a_href_page('sources docs page', 'reference') . '
    shortened, ' . news_a_href_page('kambi_vrml_test_suite',
    'kambi_vrml_test_suite') . ' repackaged and fixed
    some links to www.web3d.org VRML specification.

    <p><i>Last-minute note about FreeBSD</i>:
    compiled programs for FreeBSD <i>will not be updated</i> today.
    I\'m sorry, but currently I have terrible problems with OpenGL on
    FreeBSD &mdash; current NVidia drivers (8178) cause
    kernel crashes (it seems that they didn\'t really update their
    drivers to FreeBSD 6 ?), and Mesa is terribly unstable.
    I checked various OpenGL programs, including Mesa demos, and
    they all just fail in various mysterious ways (segfaults, hangs, etc.).
    So it\'s not a problem specific to my programs &mdash; it\'s some
    problem with my FreeBSD setup, but I don\'t have time to fight
    with it now. Anyway, after compiling, I was unable to actually
    test my programs on FreeBSD,
    so I will not upload here completely untested binaries.
    If you use FreeBSD, feel free to just compile them yourself.</div>

  <div class="old_news_item"><span class="old_news_date">February 13, 2006</span><br>
    Many modifications to my general units done, so
    ' . news_a_href_page('all units and programs sources', 'sources') . '
    are updated. As usual,
    ' . news_a_href_page('documentation generated by pasdoc',
    'reference') . ' is also updated.

    <p>New unit VRMLGLAnimation was created, to easily produce animations
    from still scenes.
    See extensive demo in <tt>vrml/opengl/examples/demo_animation.dpr</tt>,
    with raptor and sphere sample models.

    <p>I\'m also glad to add that I\'m starting in

        All VRML programs work now faster.

        <p>Added to sources file <tt>units/vrml/opengl/README.optimization_notes</tt>
        that describes how current optimization works, what are the possible
        drawbacks and what are the possible alternatives (and what

      <li>New versions of ' . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . '
        (1.1.1) and ' . news_a_href_page('lets_take_a_walk', 'lets_take_a_walk') . '
        (1.0.2) allow somewhat more smooth camera moving:
        when you try to step into the wall (or floor, or ceil, whatever),
        your move is not completely blocked. Instead you are allowed to slowly
        move alongside the wall.

        <p><small>This is implemented by new interface to
        TMatrixWalker.OnMoveAllowed and new method TVRMLOctree.MoveAllowed.</small>

      <li>I removed units gtkglext and gdkglext from my sources,
        they are now incorporated into FPC source tree.
        Also some of my fixes to gtk2 bindings are submitted to FPC sources,
        that\'s why I decided to remove gtkglext and gdkglext units
        from my sources, since you would have to download newest
        gtk2 bindings from FPC cvs anyway.

      <li><p>First part of optimizing OpenGL display using frustum culling
        done: frustum culling without the help of octree done.

        <p>User-visible changes: added <tt>--renderer-optimization</tt>
        parameter for ' . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . ', see
        ' . news_a_href_page("view3dscene", "view3dscene") . '

        menu commands "View|Show in Examine mode camera frustum",
        "Console|Print current camera frustum".

        <p><small>Sources changes:
        VRMLFlatSceneGL unit allows new optimization method:
        roSeparateShapeStates.
        VectorMath and MatrixNavigation: done routines to calculate
        frustum\'s planes, and calculate frustum\'s geometry,
        and check whether frustum collides with sphere and TBox3d.
        TVRMLFlatSceneGL.RenderFrustum done.</small>

      <li><p>Second part of optimizing OpenGL display using frustum culling
        with the help of octree: done.

        <p><small>Done second octree based on scene ShapeStates.
        ' . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . '
        creates it, and can display it\'s statistics.
        TOctree.ItemsInNonLeafNodes property added to allow
        octree nodes to store all cummulated items of their children.
        TOctree.EnumerateCollidingOctreeItems implemented and
        TVRMLFlatSceneGL.RenderFrustumOctree implemented.</small>

      <li><p>Added to sources file <tt>units/vrml/opengl/README.optimization_notes</tt>

        drawbacks and what are the possible alternatives (and what

        causing a lot of slowdown in TVRMLFlatScene.ValidateFog
        (combined with roSeparateShapeStates) fixed.
        Also problem in VRMLFlatSceneGL with GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE solved.
        Also problem with updating Caption too often (this caused
        some noticeable slowdown on XWindows on my system).

      <li><p>Example program <tt>units/vrml/opengl/simpleViewModel_2.dpr</tt>
        added.

      <li>Finally, GLWindow unit may be based on GTK 2 instead of that old GTK 1.
        Besides obvious usability benefits of using GTK 2, which is just
        better than GTK 1, also fullscreen mode is now better (things like
        gnome-panel don\'t cover your window).

      <li>Switching to FPC 1.9.8. Some archives on these pages still remain with
        binaries compiled with FPC 1.9.6, but I will replace them
        at their next update. In any case, you should use FPC 1.9.8

  <div class="old_news_item"><p><span class="old_news_date">February 3, 2005:</span>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Complete rework of Images unit interface.
        Now it has object-oriented interface, much safer and cleaner.
        Unfortunately compatibility with previous versions is broken.

        <p><b>Details</b>:
        Records TImageRec, TRGBImageRec, TAlphaImageRec are now replaced
        with classes TImage, TRGBImage, TAlphaImage (and there\'s also TRGBEImage
        class).

        <p>No functionality is lost, but now using these classes is
        more straightforward,
        no longer need to maintain "dummy" conversion routines
        ImageRec(To|From)(RGB|Alpha).
        Also now you can use Images unit to define new TImage descendant.
        Also many things are now safer and checked by compiler at compile-time.

        <p>Also many docs updated and translated to English in Images unit.

        <p>Sources of most programs needed to be changed accordingly.
        Changed: ' . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . ',
        ' . news_a_href_page('glViewImage', 'glviewimage') . ',
        ' . news_a_href_page('rayhunter', 'rayhunter') . ',
        ' . news_a_href_page('malfunction', 'malfunction') . ',
        ' . news_a_href_page('kulki', 'kambi_lines') . ',
        ' . news_a_href_page('lets_take_a_walk', 'lets_take_a_walk') . ',
        ' . news_a_href_page('bezier_curves', 'bezier_curves') . '.

      <li><p>Improvement in KambiPng/KambiZlib units:

        <p><b>Details</b>:
        Now programs using these units (e.g. indirectly by using Images unit)
        do not require libpng+zlib to be installed on user system.
        <ol>
          <li>view3dscene now runs without libpng and/or zlib installed.
            When opening kings_head.wrl, it displays a warning:
            <i>view3dscene: WARNING: Exception ELibPngNotAvailable occurred when
            trying to load texture from filename textures/crown.png :
            LibPng is not available</i>
            and loads kings_head.wrl correctly (well, without texture
            textures/crown.png).
          <li>No need to define any symbol NOT_USE_LIBPNG at compilation of
            programs that must not depend on libpng+zlib, but must depend on Images
            unit (concerns glcaps and glcaps_glut).
        </ol>

      <li><p>GTK GLWindow: key shortcuts in menus are displayed and handled
        entirely by GTK, not by some hacks in GLWindow unit.

        <p>Also WinAPI key shortcuts to menus are now displayed as they should
        (justified to the right).

      <li><p>key shortcuts changed to conform to be more standard (I\'m trying
        to follow GNOME HIG, although I know that my programs are pretty
        far from it right now), and also to not cause problems as GTK 1
        or GTK 2 menu item shortcuts:
        <ul>
          <li>glViewImage, glplotter: help: F1 (was: \'?\'),
          <li>glViewImage, lets_take_a_walk, view3dscene, glplotter:
            FullScreen on/off: Ctrl+F (was: Tab)
          <li>bezier_curves: Delete selected point: d (was: delete)
            Nothing selected: n (was: backspace).
            (I think that backspace or delete or Ctrl+Shift+A would be a better
            shortcut, but backspace or delete is impossible with GTK 1
            and Ctrl+Shift+A is impossible because of temporary lacks in GLWindow
            interface...)
        </ul>

      <li><p>All my Pascal programs get a version number.
        Existing programs on these pages are initially marked as version 1.0.0.
        Added ' . news_a_href_page('page describing my versioning scheme',
        'versioning') . '.

        <p>All programs with version number accept <tt>-v</tt> (or <tt>--version</tt>)
        command-line parameter to display version number.
        Page with ' . news_a_href_page(
        'some notes about parameters understood by my programs',
        'common_options') . ' updated.

      <li><p>From now on, all FPC programs on these pages will be compiled
        with FPC 1.9.6. Compatibility with FPC 1.0.10 is dropped,
        and I will do not even guarantee that my programs compile with FPC 1.9.4.
        So all programs are recompiled and all sources updated,
        ' . news_a_href_page('sources','sources') . '
        page is also updated.

      <li><p>Published imageToPas in <tt>units/images/tools/</tt>.

      <li><p>Small example of MathExprParser unit in units/base/examples/kambi_calc.dpr.

      <li><p>Polish version of page with ' . news_a_href_page('some notes about parameters understood by my programs',
        'opengl_options') . ' is removed. Only English version will
        be maintained from now on.

      <li><p>glViewImage has new Edit menu with some simple commands that change
        viewed image. This was done mainly to basically test that these functions
        work, but may be useful anyhow.

      <li><p>Fixed some problems with using <tt>--fullscreen-custom</tt> under Win32.

      <li><p>Removed from sources many files that were needed only for FPC 1.0.10:
        randomconf.inc, mtrand.pas, 10 files *_defpars.inc

      <li><p>UNIX (Linux, FreeBSD) versions of malfunction, kulki,
        lets_take_a_walk again have ability to change screen resolution

    nice example programs that demonstrate some higher-level

      <li><tt>units/vrml/opengl/examples/simpleViewModel.dpr</tt>
        (simple demo of loading and rendering VRML/3DS models and
        allowing user to walk in them; something like extremely-simplified
        view3dscene)
      <li><tt>units/vrml/examples/many2vrml.dpr</tt> (converting 3DS and others
        to VRML)
    </ul>
    Also ' . news_a_href_page('sources', 'sources') . ' page updated with
    comments about FPC 1.9.6 version. Also some small changes in sources,
    as usual. Added \'xxx.dylib\' library names for Darwin.

  <div class="old_news_item"><p><span class="old_news_date">31 July 2004:</span>

            This also means that now you don\'t have to specify a filename
            to open at command-line.
          <li>Fixed treating of material transparency in OpenGL rendering,
            now you can really see that various values for transparency
            (like 0.1, 0.5, 0.9) make a difference.

            comfortable dialog box. (GTK dialog box under Linux or WinAPI dialog box).

      <li>' . news_a_href_page('view3dscene', 'view3dscene') . '
        updated:
        <p>Full English docs finally available.
        Maintenance of Polish docs dropped. Many general reorganizations in docs.

        <p>Many changes in user interface in view3dscene too: some rarely used
        key bindings removed (m, g, n), many parts of menu extended to something
        more comfortable, "lights kind" replaced with 3 separate settings:
        "light calculate", "head light", "use scene lights".
        --lights-kind parameter dropped, new --light-calculate (should be much more
        useful) parameter added.

        <p>Linux (GTK) version stabilized.
      <li>Last but not least: first, unofficial release of sources of
        ' . news_a_href_page('rayhunter', 'rayhunter') . '
        is available here (<i>link not available anymore</i>).
        Currently everything
        is just packaged in one tar.gz file,
        rayhunter-src.tar.gz (<i>link not available anymore</i>). Of course it\'s GNU GPL-licensed.

        <p>You need <a href="http://www.freepascal.org">FreePascal Compiler</a>
        to compile this. You also need to slightly modify sources of FPC.
        Here are diffs for FPC 1.0.10 and FPC 1.9.3 (<i>link not available anymore</i>).
        Note that FPC 1.9.3 (downloadable
        from FreePascal CVS server) requires considerably lesser amount of
        "hacking" to compile rayhunter. If you use FPC 1.9.3, you will only have to
        apply changes to packages/libc unit under Linux, and under Windows
        everything should compile with unmodified FPC 1.9.3 version.
        While with FPC 1.0.10 there are many more patches
        and you will have to add some additional units.
        So I strongly suggest you to use FPC 1.9.3.

  <div class="old_news_item"><p><span class="old_news_date">18th of march, 2004</span>: I updated ' . news_a_href_page("view3dscene",

    Now both programs have a useful menu bar, under Windows and Linux.
    Under Linux this requires installation of GTK 1.x and gtkglarea libraries.
    This is some attempt to make user interface of those programs a little
    more friendly. I\'m curious about your observations about this improvement &mdash;
    how do you like it, how does it work under various Linux and Windows
