<p>Documentation:

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>This is <i>Castle Game Engine</i> collection of demo models.
While some of them are more impressive,
most of the models are simple and demonstrate some particular <i>Castle Game Engine</i> feature.

<p>Most of the models are in X3D and VRML formats.
but in general various formats handled by
 <a href="castle-model-viewer">Castle Model Viewer</a> and
 <?php echo a_href_page('Castle Game Engine', 'index'); ?> are used.
At the beginning of most files (remember that you can open X3D files
in normal text editor too) you can find
comments explaining what this file demonstrates.

<p>These models were created to test
<?php echo a_href_page('our Castle Game Engine', 'index'); ?>,
but many of them should also be handled by other conforming
X3D and VRML browsers.</p>

<p>Note: Files inside <code>warnings/</code> subdirectories are deliberately invalid
in some ways. Good X3D browser should display a sensible warning
message and (when possible) continue (omitting only the problematic part).</p>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>Comments and contributions to these demos are most welcome.
There are <?php echo a_href_page('many ways to contact us', 'talk'); ?>.
<!--
If you have a cool 3D model, something interesting,
or maybe just something difficult for our engine, please share it with us!
-->
<!--Posting a screenshot or a video of your model is most welcome.-->
<!--
We love to see how you use our tools :)
-->
<!--
To include your model in these demos, or to report a bug, you will of course
have to actually send your 3D model source.--></p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/demo-models">clone the demo-models repository from GitHub</a>.

<p>Most of the 3D models here were created by <i>Michalis Kamburelis</i>.
Simple test models were simply manually crafted in a text editor.
The more complicated meshes were created in
<a href="http://www.blender3d.org/">Blender</a> (see
our <a href="blender">Blender exporting documentation</a>),
you will find the .blend source files inside.
For 2D art I usually use <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>.
Skies generated with <a href="http://www.planetside.co.uk/">Terragen</a>.</p>

<p>Large/important contributions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><i>Victor Amat</i> provided a lot of interesting demos.
    To mention some:
    flat mirrors by <code>RenderedTexture</code> (see <code>x3d/rendered_texture/</code>),
    Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (see <code>shadow_maps/ssao*</code>),
    shadow maps tests (including demo to visualize bias/scale,
    <code>shadow_maps/shadow_bias.x3dv</code>),
    <code>vrml_2/camera_{orient,rot}.wrl</code>,
    <code>orientation_interpolator_alum_box.wrl</code>,
    test textures for spherical mapping testing (<code>textures/spheremap-*.jpg</code>).
    Thousand thanks!</p></li>

  <li><p><i>Stephen H. France</i> provided various tests for <code>TimeSensor</code>,
    <code>Extrusion</code> and others. Thanks!</p></li>

  <li><p>Various models were based on
    <a href="http://opengameart.org/">OpenGameArt.org</a> models,
    also some textures were taken from there. This is a great site
    where you can find models and textures on clear open-source licenses
    (GPL or CC), thousand thanks go to it's many contributors.

    <p>Examples include
    <a href="http://opengameart.org/content/shrine-shinto-japan">Shinto Shrine</a>
    (used for compositing shaders demo inside <code>compositing_shaders/shinto_shrine/</code>).
    Also a lot of textures, see <code>compositing_shaders/textures/AUTHORS.txt</code>.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p><i>Orin Palmer</i> created plane model in 3DS, see <code>3ds/p47d.3ds</code>
    and <code>3ds/p47d.txt</code>.</p></li>

  <li><p>Many textures inside <code>textures/castle/</code>
    are from <a href="http://www.wolfiesden.com/golgotha/golgotha.asp">public domain textures from unfinished game "Golgotha"</a><!-- (previously on http://www.jonathanclark.com/, but host seems dead now)-->
    </p></li>

  <li>lion bump mapping textures from
    <a href="http://www-static.cc.gatech.edu/grads/d/davidp/parallax_mapping/">Philippe
    David steep parallax mapping code</a>, based on <a href="https://www.casual-effects.com/research/McGuire2005Parallax/index.html">paper
    about steep mapping</a>.

  <li><p>See also <code>AUTHORS.txt</code> files inside the archive for detailed
    and complete listing of authors and sources.</p></li>

<p>Thanks to everyone!</p>
