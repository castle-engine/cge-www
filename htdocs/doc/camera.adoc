## Introduction

_Camera_ determines what do you see in the viewport. Camera is a cgeref:TCastleTransform[] descendant, and as such it defines:

. cgeref:TCastleTransform.Translation[] - observer position.
. cgeref:TCastleTransform.Direction[] - direction in which you look.
. cgeref:TCastleTransform.Up[] - together with _direction_, the _up_ vector determines the camera _orientation_.

A common way to set all camera vectors is to use cgeref:TCastleTransform.SetView[].

Camera also defines _projection_:

* cgeref:TCastleCamera.ProjectionType[] - determines _perspective_ or _orthographic_ projection.
* cgeref:TCastleCamera.Perspective[], cgeref:TCastleCamera.Orthographic[] - these subcomponents allow to configure projection details.

See the link:viewport_3d[Tutorial: Designing a 3D world] and link:viewport_3d[Tutorial: Designing a 2D world] to see the typical workflow how do you manipulate the camera using the editor.

## The initial camera

There are various ways to set the initial camera:

- If you design your world using the _Castle Game Engine editor_, we recommend to set the initial camera following the link:viewport_3d[Tutorial: Designing a 3D world]. This means that you just move / rotate the camera as any other cgeref:TCastleTransform[].

- Another approach is to just set the camera vectors by code during your link:views[view] start. Call cgeref:TCastleTransform.SetView[Viewport.Camera.SetView] like this:
+
[source,pascal]
----
Viewport.Camera.SetView(
  Vector3(-11.34, 30.04, 96.07), // position
  Vector3(0.10, -0.49, -0.87), // direction
  Vector3(0.35, 0.83, -0.43), // up (current)
  Vector3(0.00, 1.00, 0.00) // gravity up
);
----
+
You can even generate such Pascal code: Use the _"Clipboard -> Print Current Camera (Viewpoint) (Pascal)"_ menu item in link:castle-model-viewer[Castle Model Viewer].

- Alternatively, automatically initialize the camera defaults (including position, direction, up vectors) based on the information in the model.
+
To activate this auto-detection, set cgeref:TCastleViewport.AutoCamera[] to `true`.
+
The way this auto-detection works:
+
--
- If the scene set as cgeref:TCastleRootTransform.MainScene[Viewport.Items.MainScene] defines a default camera, then use it.
+
For example link:gltf[glTF] format allows to define a default camera. link:blender[Blender] can export such glTF models.
+
Models in In X3D can also define a default camera, using X3D `Viewpoint` or `OrthoViewpoint` nodes. If you write X3D files by hand, you can even generate such nodes using the _"Clipboard -> Print Current Camera (Viewpoint)"_ menu item in link:castle-model-viewer[Castle Model Viewer].

- Otherwise (if there is no `Viewpoint` node,or you didn't even set `MainScene`) then the camera will be auto-detected to look at the world bounding box.

## Camera can have children, and be a child of other objects

Since camera is a cgeref:TCastleTransform[] descendant:

* Camera can be a child of another cgeref:TCastleTransform[].
** For example you can attach a camera to some object (like a car or character) to move camera along with that object.
** You can combine this with cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.ExposeTransforms[ExposeTransforms] to attach a camera to an animated bone of your character.
* Camera can have other cgeref:TCastleTransform[] as children.
** For example you can attach a weapon carried by a player in FPS game as a child of camera. See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/fps_game[examples/fps_game] demo.
** You can make a headlight by simply placing a light (like cgeref:TCastleDirectionalLight[]) as camera child. See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/viewport_and_scenes/headlight[examples/viewport_and_scenes/headlight] demo.

When the camera is a child of other objects, you have to be careful when controlling camera translation / rotation from code.

- Use cgeref:TCastleTransform.GetView[], cgeref:TCastleTransform.SetView[] to get / set camera vectors in the local coordinate system.

- Use cgeref:TCastleTransform.GetWorldView[], cgeref:TCastleTransform.SetWorldView[] to get / set camera vectors in the world coordinate system.
