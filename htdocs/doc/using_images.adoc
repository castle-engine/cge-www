== Display images

There are 3 recommended ways to display an image using _Castle Game Engine_.

=== TCastleImageControl (image as user interface component)

When the image is part of a 2D user-interface, use cgeref:TCastleImageControl[]. Set the cgeref:TCastleImageControl.URL[] to load the image.

You can create such image components using Pascal code or using the CGE visual editor.

Manual chapter link:view_events[Designing user interface] describes using images in UI.

=== TCastleImageTransform (image component inside a viewport, with powerful game features)

When the image is part of the viewport, use cgeref:TCastleImageTransform[]. Set the cgeref:TCastleImageTransform.Url[] to load the image.

Such images are part of the _viewport_. See link:viewport_and_scenes[manual about viewport]. The advantages of this approach are:

- you have a camera (to control what user sees) in a vewport.
- you can trivially have a working navigation, in 3D or 2D, too.
- you can combine the image with other cgeref:TCastleTransform[] components. In particular you can add cgeref:TCastleScene[] with animations (sprite sheets), you can transform images in 3D too, you can display everything freely behind or in front of images.
- such images can have physics colliders and rigid bodies.

=== TDrawableImage (drawing image yourself)

The last method is to load the image to cgeref:TDrawableImage[]. This is the low-level approach, where you will need to manually handle drawing the image at the appropriate moment, following https://castle-engine.io/manual_2d_ui_custom_drawn.php[manual about custom-drawing UI things in CGE].

The basic code example is:

[source,pascal]
----
procedure TMyView.Create(AOwner: TComponent);
begin
  inherited;
  SomeImage := TDrawableImage.Create('castle-data:/image.png');
end;
...
procedure TMyView.Render;
begin
  inherited;
  SomeImage.Draw(XOnScreen, YOnScreen, WidthOnScreen, HeightOnScreen);
end;
----

== Which approach to use?

The approaches 1 and 2 can be used when designing the game in the https://castle-engine.io/manual_editor.php[editor] and are more advised.

Approach 3 may be easier to use in some cases (if you already think in terms _"I want to have code that draws images"_). Also cgeref:TDrawableImage.Draw[] allows to draw with batching, which allows to reliably achieve great speed when drawing large maps.

NOTE: TODO: In the future batching should also work across cgeref:TCastleImageTransform[], if you activate boolean cgeref:DynamicBatching[]. But right now, dynamic batching will not optimize multiple cgeref:TCastleImageTransform[] instances.

== Supported image formats

All approaches handle all the image formats supported by CGE, like PNG or JPG; see https://castle-engine.io/castle-view-image.php[castle-view-image] docs for the full list.

== For 2D maps: Tiled is an alternative

If you want to draw 2D maps, an alternative is to design them in https://www.mapeditor.org/[Tiled]. You can then:

1. load ready map in cgeref:TCastleTiledMapControl[]. See 2 examples in https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/tiled[examples/tiled/]. It's a UI element.

2. load ready map in cgeref:TCastleScene[].

For now cgeref:TCastleTiledMapControl[] supports a few more Tiled options.

== Internal: Image types in CGE

* cgeref:TCastleImageControl[] is a descendant of cgeref:TCastleUserInterface[] and allows to use the image as part of the UI. It refers to cgeref:TCastleImagePersistent[] to load image contents using cache. It is a trivial user-interface control to render image on the screen. It can be added and configured in the editor.
* cgeref:TCastleImageTransform[] is a descendant of cgeref:TCastleTransform[] and allows to place the image in the cgeref:TCastleViewport[], modify image size, repeat it many times etc. It is also useful from the editor.
* cgeref:TEncodedImage[] is an image loaded to a regular memory (RAM) to operate on it by Pascal code (that is, on CPU).
+
Important descendant of `TEncodedImage` is cgeref:TCastleImage[] which is an image that is expressed in memory as directly-accessible array of pixels. It has more descendants for grayscale, RGB, RGBA, float-based images etc. If you want to edit image on CPU, this is what you will use. E.g. create cgeref:TRGBAlphaImage[] and iterate over cgeref:TRGBAlphaImage.Pixels[]. There are many methods to draw lines, shapes, text to the image.
+
Images are usually 2D, but we also support 3D, for 3D (volumetric) textures.

* cgeref:TDrawableImage[] holds an image (loaded from `TEncodedImage`) on GPU. It can be actually rendered on the screen.
+
Also, you can edit this image by drawing to it on GPU, see cgeref:TDrawableImage.RenderToImageBegin[]. Example is in https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/images_videos/draw_images_on_gpu.lpr[examples/images_videos/draw_images_on_gpu.lpr].

* cgeref:TCastleImagePersistent[] is a container around `TCastleImage` and `TDrawableImage`. It is using cache to load images. It is visually configurable in the CGE editor.
+
It's like a `TPicture` in VCL -- it doesn't draw the image, but it has everything else to describe _how_ to load and draw the image. It's used by `TCastleImageControl.Image`, `TCastleButtom.CustomBackgroundNormal`, `TCastleButtom.CustomBackgroundPressed` etc.

* There are a few https://castle-engine.io/vrml_x3d.php[X3D nodes] to express images. The most important are
 ** cgeref:TImageTextureNode[] which is an image loaded from URL (set like `MyImageTexture.SetUrl(['castle-data:/my_image.png'])`)
 ** cgeref:TPixelTextureNode[] which is an image defined by `TCastleImage` (set like `MyPixelTexture.FdImage.Value := MyImage`, remember that `MyImage` becomes "owned" by `TPixelTextureNode`).

+
These nodes are used underneath when you load image into cgeref:TCastleScene[] or cgeref:TCastleImageTransform[]. We do not advise using these nodes directly,

TODO: There are too many classes above. In time, we hope to hide this complexity more, some of these classes should become internal (or not necessary at all).

## Deprecated: load image directly in TCastleScene

You can load the image to `TCastleScene`, using the `TCastleScene.Load` method (or by setting `TCastleScene.URL`). While traditionally `TCastleScene` is used for "heavier" 3D and 2D assets, it is perfectly suitable to also just use it to render a trivial rectangle with a simple image. See link:viewport_and_scenes[CGE manual about loading and using scenes].

Under the hood, this method creates nodes to define a rectangle, and applies the image as a texture. The "manual" way of achieving the same is https://castle-engine.io/x3d_implementation_geometry3d.php#section_example_pascal_rect[presented in the example code here].

This approach is deprecated now, as cgeref:TCastleImageTransform[] is better.

### Parameters when loading image to TCastleScene

By default we display an entire image. Alternatively, when loading the image to `TCastleScene`, you can use a special syntax with URL anchors to specify a subset of the image. That is, instead of

----
my_image.png
----

you can load

----
my_image.png#left:100,bottom:100,width:256,height:256
----

This will cut the appropriate subset of the image.

These are the parameters:

* `left`
+
Left coordinate of chosen rectangle (in image pixels)

* `bottom`
+
Bottom coordinate of chosen rectangle (in image pixels)

* `width`
+
Width of chosen rectangle (in image pixels)

* `height`
+
Height of chosen rectangle (in image pixels)

All the parameters are integers (we have not yet found a use-case to make them floats, but please tell us if you have such use-case).

Note that if you specify area that is too large (outside of the actual image area), the excessive pixels will show the clamped image border (the image is simply rendered as a texture with repeat=FALSE).
