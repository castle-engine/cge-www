## Short answer

Object Pascal is a

- modern,
- readable,
- fast,
- type-safe,
- cross-platform

programming language.

It is also easy to pick up if you know any OOP language. Learn more in our https://castle-engine.io/modern_pascal[Modern Object Pascal Introduction for Programmers].

## More elaborate answer

### Modern clean language to develop maintainable applications

- Object Pascal is a modern programming language. It supports classes, units, properties, generics, interfaces, reflection, closures... Everything you expect from a modern OOP language.

- The syntax puts emphasis on readable code.

- The language is type-safe. E.g. special types for booleans, strings, chars, sets, enums, ranges. Type conversions are either really safe, or have to be done explicitly.

### Fast

- Language can also be low-level if you need it to be. You can get as "close to the metal" as you need, including using pointers, doing pointer math, even using inline assembly.
+
NOTE: But you will probably not need to get "low level" in usual applications. link:/[Castle Game Engine] has *zero assembler code*.

- It is compiled to a native code (so is fast out of the box).

- Compilation is also fast.

2.5 seconds to get desktop build, 10.1 seconds to get Android build **of a new project, opened for the 1st time**. Try to match that with your engine :)

### Cross-platform

- Desktop (Windows, Linux, macOS, Raspberry Pi, FreeBSD, probably every Unix...),

- mobile (Android, iOS),

- consoles (Nintendo Switch, special in CGE),

- web (both WebAssembly and JS (using pas2js)).

See also link:features[Castle Game Engine platforms supported].

### Welcoming

- In link:/[Castle Game Engine] case, engine code and game code are in the same language. Every user is contributor!

- And the engine is open-source.

Don't hesitate to fork CGE to adjust it to your needs.

### General purpose

There are existing libraries (units) in Pascal for everything:

- database
- XML, JSON
- A.I.
- blockchain
- networking

Moreover you can easily integrate with (link to) any existing library with C API. Any renderer, sound library, physics - we can use everything.

### Ecosystem of tools

- https://www.freepascal.org/[FPC] - Free Pascal Compiler, open-source.
- https://www.lazarus-ide.org/[Lazarus] - IDE for Pascal, on top of FPC, also open-source.
- https://www.embarcadero.com/products/Delphi[Delphi] - commercial compiler and IDE for Pascal.
- https://castle-engine.io/vscode[VS Code] support - CGE, as well as many others in the Pascal ecosystem, explicitly support integration with VS Code.
