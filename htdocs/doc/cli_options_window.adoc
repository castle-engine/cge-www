# Standard command-line options for GUI programs
include::common.adoc[]
:description: C-line options for Castle Game Engine programs with a graphical interface (window options).

== Introduction

GUI programs using link:index[Castle Game Engine] accept standard command-line options listed below.

NOTE: See also link:cli_options_common[common options understood by our programs].

NOTE: To developers: The options documented on this page, and in link:cli_options_common[common options], are handled automatically if you follow the default _"New Project"_ template. This happens thanks to calling cgeref:TCastleApplication.ParseStandardParameters[Application.ParseStandardParameters] from `castleautogenerated.pas`. You can still use cgeref:TParameters[Parameters] singleton and cgeref:TParameters.Parse[Parameters.Parse] in your application code to handle any remaining options.

== Options

--fullscreen::
Start in fullscreen mode.
+
For some programs, you can also switch between fullscreen and windowed mode at runtime. Standard key shortcut for this is `F11`.

--geometry WIDTHxHEIGHT::

Start in window mode with given window `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT`.

--geometry WIDTHxHEIGHT<sign>XOFF<sign>YOFF::
Start in window mode with given window `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` and position window at `XOFF`, `YOFF`.
+
`<sign>` is either `+` or `-`:
+
--
- `\+XOFF` means that left window border should be `XOFF` pixels from left screen border. Note that `XOFF` itself may be negative (e.g. in `--geometry 100x100+-100+100`) and then window will be positioned slightly offscreen.
- `-XOFF` means that right window border should be `XOFF` pixels from right screen border.
- Similar for `+YOFF` or `-YOFF` -- they specify distance from upper or lower screen border.
--
+
Note that you can omit `WIDTHxHEIGHT` part and provide only `<sign>XOFF<sign>YOFF` part, to change window position from default, but keep default window size.
+
This option works the same as the standard `-geometry` option for most XWindows programs.
+
Note that window manager may disallow or modify requested window position and/or size.

--display DISPLAY-NAME::
_(Available only on platforms using X Windows, in practice: Linux and FreeBSD.)_
+
Set the XWindows display to use.

--log-file::
Force log to the given file. Sets cgeref:LogFileName[]. When this is not used, we determine log location using our default logic (see link:log[Logging]).

--no-limit-fps::
Disables cgeref:TCastleApplicationProperties.LimitFPS[ApplicationProperties.LimitFPS], to observe maximum possible FPS. See link:optimization[optimization] to understand when this could be useful for developers.

--capabilities automatic|force-fixed-function|force-modern::
Force rendering context to have specific capabilities, to test rendering on modern or ancient GPUs. See cgeref:TGLFeatures.RequestCapabilities[] for more information.

--pretend-touch-device::
Set cgeref:TCastleApplicationProperties.TouchDevice[ApplicationProperties.TouchDevice] to `true`. This can be useful in development, to link:touch_input[test how does the application behave on touch devices].

== Deprecated options

--fullscreen-custom WIDTHxHEIGHT::
_(Deprecated)_ Start in fullscreen mode with screen resolution changed to WIDTH x HEIGHT.
+
If given WIDTH x HEIGHT resolution is not available then error message will be shown and program will start in fullscreen mode using current screen resolution.
+
NOTE: We support changing screen resolution only on some platforms, and we don't recommend it. See link:window_size#video_change[Changing the physical screen resolution].
