== Introduction

_Sprite sheet_ is a technique for rendering animations:

* Each animation is a sequence of still images (aka "frames")
* All the frames are packed into one big image (aka "texture atlas")

cgeimg::block[sprite_sheet_editor.png|Sprite Sheet Editor]

It is a standard 2D animation technique for pixel-art games.

Note that it is not the only way to make 2D animations. In _Castle Game Engine_ you can also create smooth 2D animations, using bones or even bones+skinning, by creating 2D animations in link:spine[Spine] or even link:blender[Blender] or many other typically-3D authoring software. Creating sprite sheets has a different workflow and achieves a different result. For sprite sheet, you need to create a large set of still frames, which is sometimes easier / sometimes harder than creating an animation in Spine/Blender. Ultimately it results in an animation where you control every pixel of every frame.

== Example projects

* Platformer demo in link:https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/platformer[examples/platformer/] is a complete platformer demo using this technique.
* The template _"2D Game"_ that you can use to create a new project using the CGE editor contains some sprite sheet animations.
* Simple demo is also in https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/sprite_sheets/sprite_sheets_demo/[examples/sprite_sheets/sprite_sheets_demo].

== Using sprites

The most advised way to use sprite sheets is to create and edit them using our dedicated editor.

Our _Sprite Sheet Editor_ as part of https://castle-engine.io/manual_editor.php[our CGE editor]. Just right-click within the _"Files"_ browser at the bottom and use _New Sprite Sheet_ command, or double-click on an existing `.castle-sprite-sheet` file.

You can create sprite sheet animations in a number of ways:

* start from an existing `.castle-sprite-sheet` file,
* or add animation from a series of images,
* or import a ready image atlas,
* or import a sprite sheet in _Starling XML_ format.

Each animation has its own speed (number of frames per second). You can freely create, modify and rename animations, and move images (frames) between them.

The editor saves sprite sheets in our _Castle Game Engine format_ (`.castle-sprite-sheet` extension).

The sprite sheet file:

. points to a texture atlas (which can be any 2D image that _Castle Game Engine_ can read, like PNG or JPG; see https://castle-engine.io/castle-view-image.php[castle-view-image] docs for the full list)
. and describes frames within the file, and how they compose the final animation.

To add the sprite sheet to a cgeref:TCastleViewport[] (see link:viewport_and_scenes.adoc[viewports and scenes documentation]) create a cgeref:TCastleScene[] inside cgeref:TCastleViewport[] and assign scene `URL`, `AutoAnimation` etc. All standard methods to load and play animations work. You can do this by code (at run-time) or in the CGE editor (at design-time).

== Notes for pixel-art games

By default, textures have filtering applied, to make them look smooth when scaled.

If you want to have a pixel-art look, you can disable it easily, by

----
Scene.RenderOptions.MinificationFilter := minNearest;
Scene.RenderOptions.MagnificationFilter := magNearest;
----

== Alternative: Reading Starling and Cocos2d sprite sheet files

In addition to our _Castle Game Engine format_ (`.castle-sprite-sheet` extension), we can also read sprite sheet in these formats:

* _Starling sprite sheet format_ (traditionally with `.xml` extension, in CGE we require you rename them to `.starling-xml`).
* _Cocos2D sprite sheet format_ (traditionally with `.plist` extension, in CGE we advise (but do not require yet) to use `.cocos2d-plist`).

NOTE: Our `.castle-sprite-sheet` format is just an extended version of the Starling XML format, adding features like FPS value that is saved inside `.castle-sprite-sheet` file, and can vary for each animation.

=== URL Parameters (for Starling and Cocos2d formats)

When you load a sprite sheet, you can use a special URL syntax to indicate additional parameters. Instead of loading just `my_sprite_sheet.starling-xml` you can use URLs like this:

----
my_sprite_sheet.starling-xml#fps:10
----

or

----
my_sprite_sheet.starling-xml#fps:10,anim-naming:strict-underscore
----

The available parameters now are:

* `fps:<float>` (only for the _Starling_ and _Cocos2d_ formats)
+
Frames per second, determine the default animation speed. Note that you can later adjust the time at runtime using cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.TimePlayingSpeed[], just like with any `TCastleScene`.
+
By default we use 8 frames per second (see cgeref:DefaultSpriteSheetFramesPerSecond[]).
+
Note that this feature is not available for `.castle-sprite-sheet` files, as there the FPS is stored in the file (and can even be different for each animation). So there's no point in specifying FPS by an URL.
+
Note that, regardless of the sprite sheet format, you can always scale time by adjusting `MyScene.TimePLayingSpeed`.

* `anim-naming:strict-underscore|trailing-number` (only for the _Starling_ format)
+
Frames in Starling file can be named freely, and it is up to the loader to determine what constitutes an animation. Two values are possible:

 ** `strict-underscore`: The default behavior, strict according to the Starling format specification. To recognize subsequent frames of the animation, the animation name and frame number must be separated by an underscore, like this: `walk_01`, `walk_02`.
+
Without the underscore they will be treated as separate animations. So e.g. frames `tree1`, `tree2` would result in 2 animations, each with a single frame. This sometimes make sense, and indeed it is used, when someone wants to employ sprite sheet as a simple way to access a texture atlas with still images.

 ** `trailing-number`: The consecutive animation frames do not need any character between animation name and the frame number. So e.g. `walk1` and `walk2` will work (resulting in animation name `walk`) just like `walk_1` and `walk_2` (underscore is optional, but still stripped, so it also results in animation name `walk`).

Parameters are passed using an anchor separated by a comma, with a colon between the value and the next option name.

== Deprecated: TSprite class

You can also use `TSprite` class in CGE to load a sprite, in which case you will have to draw it explicitly. See link:how_to_render_2d[How to render 2D images/sprites].

We do not advise this approach and it is deprecated now. Using sprite sheets inside `TCastleScene` is much more powerful, and also it allows to have simpler CGE API (since you just use `TCastleScene` for all animations, sprite sheet or not).
