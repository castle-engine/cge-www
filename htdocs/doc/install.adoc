## Castle Game Engine Installation

. Download the latest link:/[Castle Game Engine].

. Run the _Castle Game Engine_ link:editor[].

If you installed the engine using Windows installer, use your Windows menu to run the _Castle Game Engine_ editor. On other systems, just unpack the engine ZIP wherever you like, and run the `castle-editor` executable (it is inside the `bin` subdirectory).

## Optional: Install additional compiler and IDE

Optionally, you can install:

* Additional Pascal compiler.
+
On Linux and Windows, the engine is bundled with a ready version of https://www.freepascal.org/[FPC], so you don't need to do anything. Compilation of CGE applications will "just work".
+
But you can also install link:delphi[Delphi] or other FPC version (e.g. using link:fpcupdeluxe[]). Configure in the the editor _"Preferences"_ which compiler to use.

* A Pascal IDE, like:
+
--
- link:vscode[Visual Studio Code] with our https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castle-engine-team.castle-engine[Castle Game Engine extension]
- link:lazarus[Lazarus]
- link:delphi[Delphi]
--
+
In principle, you can edit the Pascal code in any text editor you have.

////
For a fully open-source cross-platform environment _we recommend FPC and Lazarus_.
