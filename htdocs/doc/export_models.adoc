# Exporting 3D and 2D models

:description: How to export 3D and 2D models from various authoring tools for use with Castle Game Engine.

Our engine supports a number of standardized formats for 3D and 2D assets, most notably link:gltf[glTF] and link:x3d[X3D]. As such, you can use almost any 3D or 2D authoring tool to make models for your games.

////
So the basic guide to create 3D data for our engine is actually
trivial: export your models to the X3D, or eventually to other supported format.
////
When exporting your models, we _highly advice_ checking your models in link:castle-model-viewer[Castle Model Viewer] to see if everything is exported correctly. This is usually easier than running your whole game to test that a particular asset was exported OK. And link:castle-model-viewer[Castle Model Viewer] was implemented using our engine, so it can render exactly the same thing as your game.

////
We consciously do not try to
implement any 3D editor for our engine -- it's a wasted effort,
just look how magnificent e.g. Blender is, and how it's
constantly improving. We want to use these tools, not reinvent them.
////

The advised 3D and 2D formats to use are described on this page:

* link:model_formats[Supported model formats]

These pages describe the advised approach for a particular authoring software:

* link:blender[Blender]
* link:3dsmax[3ds Max]
* link:maya[Maya]
* link:spine[Spine]

Other hints:

* The engine by default follows the convention that the _Y axis is "up"_. This is also the recommended convention of both glTF and X3D. The exporters generally automatically adjust to it, e.g. when exporting from Blender (where the Z axis is by convention "up"), the exporter rotates your model. See link:up["Which way is up?" manual chapter] for more information about this, and how you can customize it.
////
+
In short, use standard orientation of your 3D modeller, and the developer
can make the engine adjust to it. If you use Blender, just use
standard Blender orientation (+Z is up, follow the names like "top",
"front" etc. in Blender viewports), and then export to X3D with
standard settings (this will transform models to have +Y up, which is
standard convention in VRML/X3D), and our engine will automatically
pick it up correctly.
