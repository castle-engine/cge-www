== Introduction

cgeimg::float[github_actions.png|GitHub Actions]

You can use https://docs.github.com/en/actions[GitHub Actions] to have automatic builds for your projects, done by GitHub, after every commit.

== Usage

1. Download this file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/castle-engine/castle-game/master/.github/workflows/build.yml[build.yml] and place it at `.github/workflows/build.yml` path in your project. That is, create a subdirectory `.github`, then subdirectory `workflows`, then put the `build.yml` file inside.
+
See the sample project link:https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-game/[castle-game] using it.

2. Then commit, push and just watch the GitHub _"Actions"_ tab as it picks up the commit and automatically rebuilds the project for:
+
--
* Windows (x86_64)
* Linux (x86_64)
* Android (APK contains both 32-bit and 64-bit ARM code)
* macOS (x86_64)
--
+
Ready files are available in the _"Artifacts"_ section. Download them, unpack -- this is a ready binary release of your game, for 4 systems above. You don't need to build yourself, you can just upload these files as _"release"_ on GitHub or anywhere else.

== Under the hood

The actions execute on GitHub-hosted servers, completely free for open-source projects. They rely on link:docker[Castle Game Engine Docker image] and use the latest CGE "snapshot" revision and latest stable FPC (3.2.2) now. The build is done by executing CGE link:build_tool[build tool] with proper options. You don't really need to understand it all -- our `build.yml` just does it for you.

You can customize the way it works in a myriad of ways. See https://docs.github.com/en/actions[GitHub Actions] docs.

== Taking it further: Make a release

The builds described above (actions' artifacts) will disappear after some time (link:https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts[90 days by default]). Also, users need to be signed-in to GitHub to be able to download them. So this is not a complete final solution, yet.

If you want to distribute the builds to users, you should upload them e.g. as _"release"_ on GitHub or anywhere else.

You can automate this too, using https://cli.github.com/manual/gh[GitHub CLI]. It is available both in link:docker[CGE Docker images] and in GitHub-hosted servers themselves.

For example, you can use it like this to replace files in `snapshot` release:

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
- ...
# Example GitHub Actions step that releases all *.zip, *tar.gz files
# as new files in the "snapshot" release.
- name: Release Artifacts
  if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/master' }}
  run: gh release --repo MY-ORGANIZATION/MY-PROJECT upload snapshot --clobber *.zip *.tar.gz
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
----

See step https://github.com/castle-engine/cge-fpc/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml[at the end of this workflow] for a working example.

NOTE: Above example step overwrites the `snapshot` release files every time it is done, while the release tag stays the same. It works and is useful for `snapshot` releases. But it is not a normal release setup: "normal" release should be done once, building binaries from the proper tag, and the released files should not change later. Tweak above example as you wish, e.g. to build on specific tag and/or to create a new release every time by `gh release create ...`.

See https://docs.github.com/en/actions[GitHub Actions] docs for details.
