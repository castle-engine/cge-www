:description: Steam integration with Castle Game Engine.
:cge-social-share-image: steam_cge.png

== Introduction

Out-of-the-box our engine includes integration with https://store.steampowered.com/[Steam]. This allows you to use https://partner.steamgames.com/[Steamworks] API from Pascal code to

- Use Steam achievements (list, get, set state).
- Get some information from Steam (country, language, VR mode, Steam Deck, whether some DLC is installed).

////
// TODO: do this, put engine on Steam.
// TODO: mention Steam download also in download.adoc
Independently, you can also https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306540/Castle_Game_Engine/[download Castle Game Engine using Steam]. This means that our engine is also a regular Steam application, you can download, install, update it just like any other Steam tool. We also included some fun achievements for developers to unlock :)

NOTE: Downloading the engine from Steam, and using the engine to develop Steam games, are _completely independent_. This means that you can download the engine in any way (through Steam or through link:download[our downloads]) and use it to develop games with Steam integration. And the games created using the engine you get from Steam are not automatically connected with Steam in any way.

== Example

Consult the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/steam[examples/steam] for a ready application that connects to Steam and allows to experiment with achievements -- list them, clear, set.

== Get the Steam dynamic library

In order for the integration to work, you need to set up the _Steam dynamic library_ in your project. (For start, we advise to test it with https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/steam[examples/steam] example mentioned above.) If you don't do this, then the integration will do nothing -- the game will run, but without the Steam dynamic library we cannot "talk" with Steam.

1. First, you need to be a https://partner.steamgames.com/[registered Steam partner] to have access to the Steam API.

2. Download the corresponding dynamic library from https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/list[Steamworks downloads].
+
NOTE: Current code that integrates with Steam API requires a specific version of SteamWorks: 1.57. So you need to specifically get `steamworks_sdk_157.zip`.

3. Extract the `steamworks_sdk_157.zip` wherever you like.

4. Copy the dynamic library from the extracted Steamworks SDK to your project.
+
The necessary libraries are in the `sdk/redistributable_bin/<platform>` subdirectories.
+
For example, in case of 64-bit Windows, copy the DLL file from `sdk/redistributable_bin/win64/steam_api64.dll` into the same directory as your .exe file. This is just the top-level directory of your project, if you build it in a standard fashion using our link:build_tool[build tool] or link:editor[].
+
NOTE: You can ignore `*.lib` files on Windows, they are not needed for dynamic linking.

5. _Additional step necessary on Linux_: Create a `run.sh` script to run your game on Linux with a modified `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. This is necessary to link with the Steam dynamic library. Just create a new file, called `run.sh` in your project's top-level directory with contents like this:
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
set -e
# Include current directory in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, to find Steam dynamic library
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:."
./steam_test "$@" # <- replace this with name of your application
----
+
Save this file and do `chmod +x run.sh`. Now you can execute it like `./run.sh`. Our link:build_tool[build tool] and link:editor[] are aware of this convention, so they will also execute your game through the `run.sh` script automatically.
+
See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/steam/run.sh[examples/steam/run.sh] file.
+
NOTE: The instructions above assume a simple case where you only support one Linux architecture, most likely the modern `x86_64`. If you want to support multiple architectures with Linux (Steam supports both `i386` and `x86_64` now) then you have to place the `libsteam_api.so` in a CPU-specific subdirectory and extend `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include different subdirectories, based on `uname --processor`.
+
NOTE: We deliberately say this step matters for _Linux_, not _Unix_ in general. That's because on _macOS_ (which is also _Unix_) you typically use an application bundle, and then our build tool and library loading cooperate to make things work automatically (the build tool copies `*.dylib` inside application bundle, and when loading we look inside the bundle). And other Unixes, like _FreeBSD_, are not supported by Steam as of now.

6. _Additional step to package your application_: You want to distribute your application with the Steam dynamic library. To do this, extend the link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml] in your project to package the Steam dynamic library, like this:
+
[source,xml]
----
<package>
  <!-- For 64-bit Windows -->
  <include path="steam_api64.dll" />

  <!-- For Linux -->
  <include path="run.sh" />
  <include path="libsteam_api.so" />

  <!-- For macOS: nothing is necessary for now.
    We pack lib*.dylib (and steam_appid.txt for testing)
    into bundle alongside exe automatically. -->
  <!-- include path="libsteam_api.dylib" /-->
</package>
----
+
As an example, see https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/steam/CastleEngineManifest.xml[examples/steam/CastleEngineManifest.xml].

== Using Steam integration from Pascal

Use the unit cgeref:CastleSteam[] and class cgeref:TCastleSteam[] for all the features. The typical usage goes like this:

. Define an instance of a cgeref:TCastleSteam[] class.
+
We recommend to do this in a dedicated new unit in your project, like `GameSteam`. Later you may put there other useful things related to the Steam integration (like constants for application id, achievement names etc.)
+
See the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/steam/code/gamesteam.pas[examples/steam/code/gamesteam.pas] for a working example.

. Create an instance of cgeref:TCastleSteam[] class, like this:
+
[source,pascal]
----
Steam := TCastleSteam.Create(AppId);
----
+
We recommend to do this along with the rest of your game initialization, in the callback you provided to the `Application.OnInitialize`. See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/steam/code/gameinitialize.pas[examples/steam/code/gameinitialize.pas]. But in principle, you can create it at any time.

. Right after the constructor you can check if everything is OK (in particular, we found Steam dynamic library) by checking cgeref:TCastleSteam.Enabled[].

. If cgeref:TCastleSteam.Enabled[] is `true`, then some time after you should see the cgeref:TCastleSteam.UserStatsReceived[] change from `false` to `true`. You can observe this property e.g. in the `Update` method of your view or assign a callback to cgeref:TCastleSteam.OnUserStatsReceived[].

. Once cgeref:TCastleSteam.UserStatsReceived[] is `true`, you're good to go. You can report achievements using cgeref:TCastleSteam.SetAchievement[].

== Steam application id in our example application

The example on https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/steam[examples/steam] by default uses application id of https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/api/example[SteamWorks game example: SpaceWar].

NOTE: Using this example will add the _"SpaceWar"_ game to your Steam library. Moreover, if you don't see the achievements initially (integration seems to work but 0 achievements are visible), then just view _"SpaceWar"_ in your Steam library and run our test again. This seems to be just a quirk of this test game and the way Steam automatically adds it to your library. Things are smooth for a real game that you own before you run.

However, you can edit this example to use your own application id. You will have it once you have created your own application on Steam. The application id is specified in 2 places, be sure to change them both:

1. `AppId` constant in the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/steam/code/gamesteam.pas[examples/steam/code/gamesteam.pas] unit.
2. https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/steam/steam_appid.txt[steam_appid.txt] file in the same directory as the executable.

When testing with your own game, make sure that:

- you own the application on Steam, i.e. you have it in your Steam library,
- it has some achievements set up, otherwise no achievements will be displayed by our example.

== Testing the Steam integration

Depending on how you run the game (clicking _"Play"_ in Steam, or by running the exe) and whether the `steam_appid.txt` file is present, the Steam integration will behave a bit differently.

The important advise is: When you upload the application to Steam, or when you give end-users a ZIP with the game (with Steam integration included), *do not* include the `steam_appid.txt` file. The `steam_appid.txt` file is supposed to be used only during development -- see below, it prevents from ever restarting the process.

Details, how the game behaves:

1. _Ways to run the game for end-users_:
+
--
1. _Running the game by clicking "Play" from Steam_: This is the most common way how end-users run a Steam game. Of course Steam integration "just works" in this case.

2. _Running the game by running the exe file directly (without the `steam_appid.txt` file present)_: In this case, the exe will immediately close and restart the game through Steam. It will even start Steam (and display Steam login dialog if necessary), if Steam was not running already.
+
This even works if Steam is not *installed* (we tested this case on Windows). In this case, the game will *not* restart, and it will continue to work (without Steam integration of course).
+
This is a nice way when you want to distribute your game as a ZIP file but you want it to still integrate with Steam (e.g. report achievements), if only user has Steam.
// TODO: What happens if user doesn't own the app on Steam.
--

2. _Ways to run the game that should only be used during development_:
+
--
1. _Running the game by running the exe file directly (with the `steam_appid.txt` file present), when Steam runs in the background_: Steam integration still works (and the game doesn't need to restart).

2. _Running the game by running the exe file directly (with the `steam_appid.txt` file present), when Steam does not run in the background_: Steam integration will not work. But nothing crashes etc. So it's not a problem, just remember during testing that Steam achievements are not collected in this case.

== Platforms supported and tested

- Windows / x86_64
- Windows / i386
- Linux / x86_64
- Linux / i386 _(TODO: untested, but should work out-of-the-box)_
- macOS / x86_64
- macOS / arm64 _(TODO: untested, but should work out-of-the-box)_

_Castle Game Engine_ supports a few more platforms (even for desktop, like _Linux / Aarch64_ or _FreeBSD_), but Steam does not support other platforms.

NOTE: We put quite some effort to make our Steam integration code clean and simple. E.g. there's no wrapper library. And we dispatch Steam callbacks using the `SteamAPI_ManualDispatch_GetNextCallback` and friends -- no assembler, no hacks to simulate C++ VMT. This implies that our integration should "just work" on any platform supported by Steam, as long as you provide the Steam dynamic library.

== TODO

- https://partner.steamgames.com/[Steamworks] includes a lot of useful features and in time, we plan to integrate them more. For example
+
--
- support joysticks through Steam API (would allow to account for essentially any gamepad in a uniform fashion).
- support SteamDeck-specific API (e.g. to invoke on-screen keyboard).
--

- We also plan to simplify some pieces of above _"Get the Steam dynamic library"_ section. The need to define `run.sh` and extend `<package>` should disappear once we define _"services on desktop platforms"_, this is part of our link:roadmap[] about making packages.
