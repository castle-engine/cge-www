# URLs, loading (downloading) and saving resources
include::common.adoc[]
:description: TODO
:cge-social-share-image: delphi_linux_downloads.png

== Introduction

All methods in our engine take URL as the parameter,
not just a _filename_. Although in most cases you can also pass
a filename (absolute or relative to the current directory),
and it will also work as expected.

All loading and saving routines (for models, images, sounds, and all
other resources) automatically deal with URLs.

cgeimg::block[
  delphi_linux_downloads.png|asynchronous_download example\, downloading multiple URLs asynchronously (without blocking the UI)
]

== Loading and saving any URL using TStream, synchronously or asynchronously

To directly load or save _your own files_ using ObjectPascal `TStream`:

- *To load (easily)*, use the cgeref:Download[] function. It simply returns a `TStream` that contains the resource indicated by the URL. It supports all the protocols mentioned below, e.g. `file`, `castle-data`.
+
It can also load data from a ZIP file if you associate a custom protocol with your ZIP file. See cgeref:TCastleZip.RegisterUrlProtocol[].
+
It can even download data using `http` or `https` protocols, although you need to set cgeref:EnableBlockingDownloads[] to `true` for this.

- *To load asynchronously* (to continue the flow of your application while the download takes place in the background), use the cgeref:TCastleDownload[] class. It presents a trivial API to start and watch the download progress, and offers a lot of features for HTTP requests. When the cgeref:TCastleDownload.Status[] is cgeref:dsSuccess[] you have the data (as a `TStream`) inside cgeref:TCastleDownload.Contents[].
+
It supports all our protocols. It can download data using `http` or `https` protocols without any issues.
+
It can be used to communicate with a REST server.
+
Examples:
+
--
- https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/network/asynchronous_download/[examples/network/asynchronous_download/] demonstrates multiple simultaneous downloads, along with a 3D animation, running smoothly.

- https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/network/castle_download/[examples/network/castle_download/] implements a simple command-line downloading tool (like `wget` or `curl` using our engine).

- https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/network/remote_logging/[examples/network/remote_logging/] sends asynchronous HTTP POST message.

- https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/network/ask_openai_assistant[examples/network/ask_openai_assistant: Talking with OpenAI assistant (essentially your own, customized ChatGPT)] is an example of using `CastleDownload` to communicate with a REST server.
--

- *To save*, use cgeref:UrlSaveStream[] function.
+
It can save to a local file.
+
It can also write to a ZIP file if you associate a custom protocol with your ZIP file. See cgeref:TCastleZip.RegisterUrlProtocol[].

== Loading and saving specialized resources

More higher-level loading and saving routines are available. They are all implemented on top of the above functions dealing with `TStream`, so they all support all registered URLs.

- To read / write text files from an URL, use cgeref:TCastleTextReader[] and cgeref:TCastleTextWriter[].

- To read / write text files as a simple `String` from an URL, use cgeref:FileToString[] and cgeref:StringToFile[].

- To read / write 3D models, use cgeref:LoadNode[] and cgeref:SaveNode[].
+
Or (advised for most cases) use higher-level classes for 3D models: just set cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.Url[] to read and call cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.Save[] to write. See link:viewport_and_scenes[viewport and scenes] for more information.

- To read / write images, use cgeref:LoadImage[] and cgeref:SaveImage[].
+
Or (advised for most cases) use even higher-level classes for displaying images: cgeref:TCastleImageTransform[], cgeref:TCastleImageControl[]. See link:using_images[using images] for more information.

- To read audio files, use cgeref:TCastleSound[]. See link:sound[sound] for more information.

- To read / write XML files, use cgeref:UrlReadXML[] and cgeref:UrlWriteXML[].

- To read / write serialized components in JSON files, use routines in cgeref:CastleComponentSerialize[] unit.

== Searching the filesystem

Use cgeref:UriExists[] to detect if given URL exists. It returns _instantly_ (without making any network request):

cgeref:ueFile[]::
URL is as a file.
cgeref:ueDirectory[]::
URL is as a directory.
cgeref:ueNotExists[]::
URL doesn't exist.
cgeref:ueUnknown[]::
We don't know.

The above values account for various filesystems and URL protocols:

- On a regular filesystem we can naturally just query whether files / directories exist.
+
This happens when using `file:/` protocol, or URL protocol that resolves to a cgeref:TCastleZip[] or to cgeref:TCastleMemoryFileSystem[].
+
We also have special handling for file existence and searching in the link:data[castle-data:/] URLs.

- On the other hand, for network URLs like `http://example.org/my_file.txt` we generally don't know the answer so we return cgeref:ueUnknown[].
+
If you really need to know whether the resource exists, just try opening it using cgeref:Download[] or cgeref:TCastleDownload[].

Use cgeref:FindFiles[] to find all files matching a given mask (with wildcards `*` and `?`) in a directory. This is handled by all URL protocols where it is possible, so you can search normal filesystem, ZIP files, cgeref:TCastleMemoryFileSystem[], link:data[castle-data:/] subdirectories and more. Example:

[source,pascal]
----
procedure TMyView.SearchTextures;
begin
  { Find all *.png in textures/ subdirectory of data. }
  FindFiles('castle-data:/textures/', '*.png', false,
    {$ifdef FPC}@{$endif} FindFileEvent, [ffRecursive]);
end;

procedure TMyView.FindFileEvent(const FileInfo: TFileInfo; var StopSearch: boolean);
begin
  WritelnLog('Found texture: %s', [
    FileInfo.Url
  ]);
end;
----

== Case-sensitive filesystems and URLs

Often, URLs just refer to files on the filesystem. Like `file://` URLs, or `castle-data:/` URLs (on platforms where the link:data[application data] is just a set of regular files). In this case, the underlying filesystem determines whether the names are *case-sensitive* (so e.g. `foobar` vs `FooBar` mean something else) or not.

- On most operating systems (like _Linux_, _FreeBSD_, _macOS_; but also mobile and console filesystems) the filesystems are typically case-sensitive.

- On _Windows_, the filesystems are typically _not_ case-sensitive.

NOTE: To complicate matters, whether the filesystem is _case sensitive_ or not is not actually determined by the OS. You can mount on Windows a case-sensitive filesystem like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4[Ext4]. You can mount on Linux a case-ignoring filesystem like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS[NTFS]. So the filesystems can be case-sensitive or not on any OS.

To make the application work on all platforms, be sure to always specify the same case in URLs as your files. So, _assume that URLs are case-sensitive_.

E.g. take care if you load `castle-data:/FooBar.png` or `castle-data:/foobar.png`. Using wrong letter case may be an easy mistake, because on Windows both versions will work, but on Linux only the version with correct case.

If you don't want to care about the latter case (which makes sense if you develop mostly on Windows but want your application to also work on other platforms), a simple solution is to set global variable cgeref:CastleDataIgnoreCase[] to `true`.

== Supported protocols

=== Loading local files: `file`

To load normal files from disk, use a `file` URL.

Absolute file URLs look like this: `file:///c:/windows/clock.avi` (on Windows) or `file:///etc/fstab` (on Unix). You can also use normal absolute filenames with most engine routines, like `c:\windows\clock.avi` (on Windows; you can use slash or backslash) or `/etc/fstab` (on Unix).

In most cases hardcoding an absolute filename in your application
is not very useful (since it would be specific to a particular system).
Using relative URLs makes more sense, like `textures/wood.png`.
Relative URLs should use slashes, and work naturally when used
in other files (relative URL is then relative to the containing file)
or code (relative URL is then relative to _the current working directory_).
Note that the _current working directory_ depends on how the user
runs your application.

To reliably load game data from code you should
use link:data[`castle-data` protocol],
not `file` protocol.

cgeref:CastleUriUtils[] contains routines to operate on URLs (and more general URIs),
including converting between regular filenames and URLs with
`file:` protocol.

- Use this to convert a FileName (relative or absolute) to an absolute URL:
+
[source,pascal]
----
URL := FilenameToUriSafe(FileName);
----

- Use this to convert something that may be a FileName or URL to an URL. This is safer than `FilenameToUriSafe(...)`, in that it will never touch something that already is an URL.
// On the other hand, there are some obscure cases (when a relative filename starts with a component with colon inside) when it may think that it has URL, while in fact it has a filename that should be converted to `file:` URL.
+
[source,pascal]
----
URL := AbsoluteUri(FileNameOrUrl);
----

- Use this to convert URL back to a FileName. When the URL is a `file:` protocol, it will decode back the simple filename. Right now, URL without protocol is also returned back as a simple filename. When the URL uses a different protocol (like `http`), returns empty string.
+
[source,pascal]
----
FileName := UriToFilenameSafe(URL);
----

See reference of cgeref:FilenameToUriSafe[], cgeref:AbsoluteUri[], cgeref:UriToFilenameSafe[].

////
See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/doc/miscellaneous_notes/uri_filename.txt[doc/miscellaneous_notes/uri_filename.txt] for more internal comments.


If you read/write filenames from/to link:http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/[Lazarus] classes,
for example if you use Lazarus `TOpenDialog.FileName` or
`TSaveDialog.FileName`, you can use the UTF-8 variants instead:
cgeref:UriToFilenameSafeUTF8[] and
cgeref:FilenameToUriSafeUTF8[].
But it doesn't matter in practice.
Both _Castle Game Engine_ and _Lazarus_ configure FPC RTL to use UTF-8 for all strings
(by default FPC RTL uses system-dependent encoding).
////

_On Android_, you should use the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/tools/build-tool/data/android/services/read_external_storage/README.md[read_external_storage service] to be able to read storage files (e.g. from SD card) through the `file` protocol.

=== Loading data files: `castle-data`

This protocol should be used to load
link:data[data files] of your project.
During development, on normal desktop systems (Windows, Linux etc.),
the _data files_ are simply files
inside the `data` subdirectory of your project.
You should place there all the files loaded at runtime by your application.

When the application is packaged for some systems,
like Android or iOS, the data directory may be treated in a special way.
If you access all the data files using the `castle-data` protocol
(or using URLs relative to files loaded using the `castle-data` protocol)
then your application will "just wok" on all systems.

See the link:data[documentation about the data directory].

Note that you can adjust
cgeref:ApplicationDataOverride[]
 to host your data files wherever you want.
This way data files may even be loaded from `http` location.
On desktop systems, the data location is by default
just a regular directory on disk, but you can change it.

////
The castle-data:/ URL designates files inside the application data directory. When developing, this is usually the subdirectory "data/" of your project. When the application is installed, this is sometimes a special directory within the filesystem, sometimes a special filesystem (read-only "assets" on Android). Use this for all your game's URLs to have a completely self-contained game that will work on any OS.

When setting the URLs of various components from Lazarus, by clicking on "..." in the Lazarus Object Inspector, we automatically detect when you chose a file inside the "data/" subdirectory, and change the URL into appropriate castle-data:/ (instead of a file:/ URL).
////

[#castle-config]
=== Writing data (specific to given user): `castle-config`

If you need to _write_ some data, use the `castle-config:/` protocol to access space for writing resources (config files, savegames, user projects...). For example

[source,pascal]
----
var
  MyUrl: String;
  MyStream: TStream;
begin
  MyUrl := 'castle-config:/my_data.txt';
  MyStream := UrlSaveStream(MyUrl);
  try
    // TODO: write to MyStream whatever you need
  finally
    FreeAndNil(MyStream);
  end;
end;
----

Notes:

- The URLs `castle-config:/xxx` point to writeable resources.
+
If case of regular desktops, these are just files and opening them with cgeref:UrlSaveStream[] does underneath just `TFileStream.Create(FileName, fmCreate)`.

- We follow OS-specific conventions and APIs to determine a space for writing user-specific data. For example `castle-config:/my_file.txt` maps to:
+
--
- On Linux and FreeBSD: `/home/<username>/.config/<application-name>/my_file.txt`
- On Windows: `C:/Users/<username>/AppData/Local/<application-name>/my_file.txt`
--
+
To be more precise, on most systems we use logic from http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/sysutils/ongetapplicationname.html[FPC GetAppConfigDir function]. (When using Delphi, we have a compatibility implementation with similar logic.) This in turn looks at cgeref:TCastleApplicationProperties.ApplicationName[ApplicationProperties.ApplicationName] and follows the OS-specific conventions and APIs to determine the best config directory. On UNIX this follows http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html[XDG Base Directory Specification].

- The contents saved to `castle-config:/xxx` are _persistent_ across program runs. Use it for savegames, databases (e.g. using https://wiki.freepascal.org/SQLite[SQLite]), user preferences, etc.

- Our link:manual_user_prefs.php[UserConfig] is also saved there. It's just in file `castle-config:/<application-name>.conf`.
+
NOTE: Using the `<application-name>` for link:manual_user_prefs.php[UserConfig] location is somewhat superfluous, as it is already stored in the `castle-config:/` directory that is application-specific. But it does seem consistent with what some other applications are doing and makes it easy to find the file in weird situations, in case it gets mixed up with other files.

- Using the `castle-config:/` URL literally (without anything more) indicates the top-level directory of the user configuration. It is initially (when user first runs the application) empty. But you can create as many files there as you want.
//There is no special way to initialize it with some files before your first application run.

- If you want to initialize something in your _config_ based on your _data_, do it explicitly -- e.g. like this:
+
```delphi
uses SysUtils, CastleClassUtils;

procedure MakeSureMyStuffExistsInConfig;
var
  OutputStream, InputStream: TStream;
begin
  if not UriExists('castle-config:/my_stuff.data') then
  begin
    OutputStream := UrlSaveStream('castle-config:/my_stuff.data');
    try
      InputStream := Download('castle-data:/my_stuff_initial.data');
      try
        ReadGrowingStream(InputStream, OutputStream, true);
      finally FreeAndNil(InputStream) end;
    finally FreeAndNil(OutputStream) end;
  end;
end;
```

- The subdirectories inside `castle-config:/` are automatically created as you save files using cgeref:UrlSaveStream[]. So e.g. the code below "just works" and will create `my_subdirectory` automatically:
+
```delphi
MyStream := UrlSaveStream('castle-config:/my_subdirectory/my_data.txt');
```

=== Downloading from the network: `http` and `https`

`http` and `https` work.
You can download data from the Internet,
and the cgeref:TCastleDownload[]
 has a support for various HTTP methods (GET, POST).
You can use this for simple downloading, or for full-featured communication with a REST
server.

Asynchronous cgeref:TCastleDownload[]
 supports `http` and `https` automatically.
It is perfect to use with unreliable / slow network.

Synchronous cgeref:Download[]
 supports these protocols only if you set global variable
 cgeref:EnableBlockingDownloads[]
 to `true`.
We call them "blocking downloads" because the application has to simply wait for
the download to finish and there's no way to interrupt the download
(without just killing the application) or even watch the progress.
////
So these "blocking downloads" are easy to use from code,
but may cause your application to hang,
as network may be slow / unreliable.
////
We advise always using cgeref:TCastleDownload[]
 to get data from the network -- although it requires
 a bit more effort from code, but allows to observe and interrupt the download.

For the `https` (encrypted version of `http`) protocol to work:

- For FPC: Use the `OpenSSLSockets` unit. Simply add this to the uses clause of one of your units (like `GameInitialize`):
+
[source,pascal]
----
{$ifdef FPC} OpenSSLSockets, {$endif} // support HTTPS
----

- Make sure users have the OpenSSL library installed.
+
On Unix (Linux, FreeBSD, macOS...), it is standard to have OpenSSL installed already system-wide. Developers and users likely don't need to do anything.
+
On Windows, use the appropriate DLLs.
    Our link:editor[editor] (or command-line link:build_tool[build tool])
    will automatically place the proper DLLs alongside your EXE file on the first build.
    You only need to add `<dependency name="Https" />` in your
    link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml].

See an example like
https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/network/asynchronous_download/[examples/network/asynchronous_download/]
that does both things above, to make `https` work.

Note that we use URLs, not filenames, throughout the entire engine API.
So to load something from the network, you can just pass e.g. `https://...`
to cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.Load[].

Inside models (like X3D, glTF and other), you can also refer to network resources,
and it will "just work".
For example you can use X3D `Inline` node to inline a model from given URL,
you can use X3D `Anchor` node to switch to given model on click,
you can refer to textures and sounds and scripts and everything else
from the network. Relative URLs are always resolved
with respect to the containing document.

_On Android_, you should use the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/tools/build-tool/data/android/services/download_urls/README.md[download_urls service] to support `http` and `https` protocols.

=== Embedded data: `data`

`data` is a special protocol that doesn't refer to
an external resource. Instead, the complete data URI _contains_ the contents.
// (yes, it's often quite long, longer than normal URLs).
This allows to embed various resources
(like textures, sounds, other 3D models) inside a parent file.
For example instead of referring to the texture filename from 3D model --
you can embed the actual texture contents inside 3D model file.
This is sometimes a very nice feature (it makes the file easier to distribute).

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme[data: URI specification].
Our engine includes a tool `to-data-uri` that can turn any file
into a data URI, and you can use such data URI everywhere where we expect URL.
`to-data-uri` is link:download[provided in the regular engine download in the `bin/` subdirectory], also
https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/tools/to-data-uri/to-data-uri.lpr[source code is here].

Wherever our engine, or X3D, says that it expects a URL -- you can use data URI
to provide the contents "right there", without using any additional file.
// You can say that the data URI is "self-contained".

Demos of using data URI are inside link:demo_models[our demo models], see in particular https://github.com/castle-engine/demo-models/blob/master/x3d/data_uri.x3dv[x3d/data_uri.x3dv].

[#zip]
=== Data from a zip

You can open and register an arbitrary ZIP file to read / write resources from it using a custom URL. See the cgeref:TCastleZip.RegisterUrlProtocol[] docs.

See the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/network/custom_url_handler[examples/network/custom_url_handler], when `USE_ZIP_URL_HANDLER` is defined.

=== Memory (temporary) filesystem

Use cgeref:TCastleMemoryFileSystem[] to create a temporary filesystem in memory. You can register it as a URL protocol and use for any purpose.

[#register]
=== Registering your own protocol

You are not limited to the protocols documented here. You can register your own URL protocols, with custom reading and writing handlers, using cgeref:RegisterUrlProtocol[].

See the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/network/custom_url_handler[examples/network/custom_url_handler], when `USE_ZIP_URL_HANDLER` is undefined.

////
This protocol is called `castle-android-assets` or (deprecated name) `assets`. It is only available on Android.

Used to access data files in an Android application.
"Asset" files live inside your application's .apk file, together with your compiled game.
The link:build_tool[build tool]
will copy the `data` directory of your game to Android assets.
For example, file that was in `data/my_texture.png` in your source code
can be accessed (from the Android app) using the URL `assets:/my_texture.png`.

_You should never explicitly use this protocol name_,
as it does not work on other platforms than Android.
Instead, use < ?php echo cgeRef('ApplicationData'); ? >
 to refer to your data files from code. The
< ?php echo cgeRef('ApplicationData'); ? >
 will always return an absolute URL to the data file location on current platform.
On Android it will start with `castle-android-assets:/...` but you should treat this
as an internal detail.

<!--
Inside your data, when referring from one data file to another,
e.g. when an 3D file refers to a texture,
use relative URLs.
-->

<!--
Usage of `assets:/` protocol to access Android assets by URLs is
consistent link:http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtdoc/platform-notes-android.html#assets-file-system[at least with Qt].
See also <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/index.html">Android
docs for more information about assets and project layout</a>.
-->

////

== Dialog windows that support URLs

If you use
cgeref:TCastleWindow[],
it gives you a ready
cgeref:TCastleWindow.FileDialog[]
 that takes and returns URLs.

If you use Lazarus with
cgeref:TCastleControl[],
we advise to use our dialog components:
cgeref:TCastleOpenDialog[],
cgeref:TCastleSaveDialog[],
cgeref:TCastleOpenSceneDialog[],
cgeref:TCastleOpenImageDialog[],
cgeref:TCastleSaveImageDialog[].
They expose `URL` property which works naturally with CGE.

////
You can also continue using standard Lazarus dialog components.
Our routines (almost) always handle a filename instead of an URL,
or you can explicitly convert between filenames and URLs using functions
mentioned earlier.
////

== Notes about terminology: URI vs URL

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier[URI]
is a more general term. URI uniquely identifies a resource but does not
necessarily tell us how to load (download) or save (upload) it.
We have many routines in cgeref:CastleUriUtils[]
 unit that process URIs (strings), they use the more general term `URI`.
They complement standard FPC `URIParser` routines.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator[URL]
is a specific type of URI that also tells you how to load or save the resource.
For example `http` and `file` protocols define URLs.
Most of our routines that load or save use the term `URL`.

Things get a little more cloudy when you realize there's also
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme[data URI scheme].
It's not precisely an URL (it's not an address of a resource),
but you _can_ load it (since the URI itself contains the resource).
And we support it fully (our
cgeref:Download[] method
loads it automatically). Admittedly, this means that our loading routines
should rather use the term _URL or data URI_, but that's just long
and (for those who don't use data URI) confusing, so for simplicity we
just keep (over-)using the term _URL_. Also, other standards (like CSS
and X3D) allow placing _data URIs_ inside fields called `url`.

If you enjoy reading about Internet terminology,
note that we use in our engine also
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_name[URNs]
(another subtype of URI). They are used by link:x3d[X3D] external prototypes.
