<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>All methods in our engine take URL as the parameter,
not just a <i>filename</i>. Although in most cases you can also pass
a filename (absolute or relative to the current directory),
and it will also work as expected.

<p>All loading and saving routines (for models, images, sounds, and all
other resources) automatically deal with URLs.

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>To directly load or save <i>your own files</i> using ObjectPascal <code>TStream</code>:

<ul>
  <li><p><b>To load (easily)</b>, use the
    <?php echo cgeRef('Download'); ?> function.
    It simply returns a <code>TStream</code> that contains the resource indicated by the URL.
    It supports all the protocols mentioned below, e.g. <code>file</code>,
    <code>castle-data</code>.

    <p>It can also load data from a ZIP file if you associate a custom protocol
    with your ZIP file. See <?php echo cgeRef('TCastleZip.RegisterUrlProtocol'); ?>.

    <p>It can even download data using <code>http</code> or <code>https</code> protocols,
    although you need to set <?php echo cgeRef('EnableBlockingDownloads'); ?>
    to <code>true</code> for this.

  <li><p><b>To load asynchronously</b>
    (to continue the flow of your application while the download takes place in the background),
    use the
    <?php echo cgeRef('TCastleDownload'); ?> class.
    It presents a trivial API to start and watch the download progress,
    and offers a lot of features for HTTP requests.
    When the
    <?php echo cgeRef('TCastleDownload.Status'); ?>
    is
    <?php echo cgeRef('dsSuccess'); ?>
    you have the data
    (as a <code>TStream</code>) inside
    <?php echo cgeRef('TCastleDownload.Contents'); ?>.

    <p>It supports all our protocols.
    It can download data using <code>http</code> or <code>https</code> protocols
    without any issues.
    It can be used to communicate with a REST server.

    <p>Examples:

    <ul>
      <li><p><a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/network/asynchronous_download/">examples/network/asynchronous_download/</a>
        demonstrates multiple simultaneous downloads, along with a 3D animation,
        running smoothly.

      <li><p><a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/network/castle_download/">examples/network/castle_download/</a>
        implements a simple command-line downloading tool
        (like <code>wget</code> or <code>curl</code> using our engine).

      <li><p><a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/network/remote_logging/">examples/network/remote_logging/</a>
        sends asynchronous HTTP POST message.

      <li><p><a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-openai">castle-openai: Talking with OpenAI assistant (essentially your own, customized ChatGPT)</a> is an example of using <code>TCastleDownload</code> to communicate with a REST server.
    </ul>

  <li><p><b>To save</b>, use
    <?php echo cgeRef('UrlSaveStream'); ?> function.

    <p>It can save to a local file.

    <p>It can also write to a ZIP file if you associate a custom protocol
    with your ZIP file. See <?php echo cgeRef('TCastleZip.RegisterUrlProtocol'); ?>.
</ul>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>More higher-level loading and saving routines are available.
They are all implemented on top of the above functions dealing with <code>TStream</code>,
so they all support all registered URLs.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To read / write text files from an URL, use
    <?php echo cgeRef('TTextReader'); ?> and
    <?php echo cgeRef('TTextWriter'); ?>.

  <li>
    <p>To read / write text files as a simple <code>String</code> from an URL, use
    <?php echo cgeRef('FileToString'); ?> and
    <?php echo cgeRef('StringToFile'); ?>.

  <li>
    <p>To read / write 3D models, use
    <?php echo cgeRef('LoadNode'); ?> and
    <?php echo cgeRef('SaveNode'); ?>.

    <p>Or (advised for most cases) use higher-level classes for 3D models: just set
    <?php echo cgeRef('TCastleSceneCore.Url'); ?> to read and
    call <?php echo cgeRef('TCastleSceneCore.Save'); ?> to write.
    See <a href="viewport_and_scenes">viewport and scenes</a> for more information.

  <li>
    <p>To read / write images, use
    <?php echo cgeRef('LoadImage'); ?> and
    <?php echo cgeRef('SaveImage'); ?>.

    <p>Or (advised for most cases) use even higher-level classes for displaying images:
    <?php echo cgeRef('TCastleImageTransform'); ?>,
    <?php echo cgeRef('TCastleImageControl'); ?>.
    See <a href="using_images">using images</a> for more information.

  <li>
    <p>To read audio files, use <?php echo cgeRef('TCastleSound'); ?>.
    See <a href="sound">sound</a> for more information.

  <li>
    <p>To read / write XML files, use
    <?php echo cgeRef('UrlReadXML'); ?> and <?php echo cgeRef('UrlWriteXML'); ?>.

  <li>
    <p>To read / write serialized components in JSON files, use routines in
    <?php echo cgeRef('CastleComponentSerialize'); ?> unit.
</ul>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>Often, URLs just refer to files on the filesystem. Like <code>file://...</code> URLs, or <code>castle-data:/...</code> URLs (on platforms where the <a href="data">application data</a> is just a set of regular files). In this case, the underlying filesystem determines whether the names are <b>case-sensitive</b> (so e.g. <code>foobar</code> vs <code>FooBar</code> mean something else) or not.

<ul>
  <li><p>On most systems (like <i>Linux</i>, <i>FreeBSD</i>, <i>macOS</i>; but also mobile and console filesystems) the filesystems are typically case-sensitive.

  <li><p>On <i>Windows</i>, the filesystems are typically <i>not</i> case-sensitive.
</ul>

<p><i>WARNING:</i> To complicate matters more, whether the filesystem is <i>case sensitive</i> or not &mdash; is not exactly determined by the OS. You can mount on Windows a case-sensitive filesystem like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4">Ext4</a>. You can mount on Linux a case-ignoring filesystem like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS">NTFS</a>. So the filesystems can be case-sensitive or not on any OS.

<p>To make the application work on all platforms, be sure to always specify the same case in URLs as your files. So, <i>assume that URLs are case-sensitive</i>.

<p>E.g. take care if you load <code>castle-data:/FooBar.png</code> or <code>castle-data:/foobar.png</code>. Using wrong letter case may be an easy mistake, because on Windows both versions will work, but on Linux only the version with correct case.

<p>If you don't want to care about the latter case (which makes sense if you develop mostly on Windows but want your application to also work on other platforms), a simple solution is to set global variable <?php echo cgeRef('CastleDataIgnoreCase'); ?> to <code>true</code>.

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>To load normal files from disk, use a <code>file</code> URL.

<p>Absolute file URLs look like this:
<code>file:///c:/windows/clock.avi</code> (on Windows)
or <code>file:///etc/fstab</code> (on Unix).
You can also use normal absolute filenames with most CGE routines, like
<code>c:\windows\clock.avi</code> (on Windows; you can use slash or backslash)
or <code>/etc/fstab</code> (on Unix).

<p>In most cases hardcoding an absolute filename in your application
is not very useful (since it would be specific to a particular system).
Using relative URLs makes more sense, like <code>textures/wood.png</code>.
Relative URLs should use slashes, and work naturally when used
in other files (relative URL is then relative to the containing file)
or code (relative URL is then relative to <i>the current working directory</i>).
Note that the <i>current working directory</i> depends on how the user
runs your application.

<p>To reliably load game data from code you should
use <a href="data"><code>castle-data</code> protocol</a>,
not <code>file</code> protocol.

<p><?php echo cgeRef('CastleUriUtils'); ?>
 contains routines to operate on URLs (and more general URIs),
including converting between regular filenames and URLs with
<code>file:</code> protocol.

<ul>
  <li><p>Use this to convert a FileName (relative or absolute)
  to an absolute URL.

<?php echo pascal_highlight(
'URL := FilenameToUriSafe(FileName);'); ?>

  <li><p>Use this to convert something that may be a FileName or URL to an URL.
  This is safer than <code>FilenameToUriSafe(...)</code>, in that it will
  never touch something that already is an URL.
  <!--
  On the other hand, there are some obscure cases
  (when a relative filename starts with a component with colon inside)
  when it may think that it has URL, while in fact it has a filename that
  should be converted to <code>file:</code> URL.
  -->

<?php echo pascal_highlight(
'URL := AbsoluteUri(FileNameOrUrl);'); ?>

  <li><p>Use this to convert URL back to a FileName.
  When the URL is a <code>file:</code> protocol, it will decode back
  the simple filename. Right now, URL without protocol is also
  returned back as a simple filename. When the URL uses a different
  protocol (like <code>http</code>), returns empty string.

<?php echo pascal_highlight(
'FileName := UriToFilenameSafe(URL);'); ?>
</ul>

<p>See reference of
<?php echo cgeRef('FilenameToUriSafe'); ?>,
<?php echo cgeRef('AbsoluteUri'); ?>,
<?php echo cgeRef('UriToFilenameSafe'); ?>.
<!--
See <a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/doc/miscellaneous_notes/uri_filename.txt">doc/miscellaneous_notes/uri_filename.txt</a> for more internal comments.
-->

<!--
<p>If you read/write filenames from/to <a href="http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/">Lazarus</a> classes,
for example if you use Lazarus <code>TOpenDialog.FileName</code> or
<code>TSaveDialog.FileName</code>, you can use the UTF-8 variants instead:
<?php echo cgeRef('UriToFilenameSafeUTF8'); ?> and
<?php echo cgeRef('FilenameToUriSafeUTF8'); ?>.
But it doesn't matter in practice.
Both <i>Castle Game Engine</i> and <i>Lazarus</i> configure FPC RTL to use UTF-8 for all strings
(by default FPC RTL uses system-dependent encoding).
-->

<p><i>On Android</i>, you should use the <a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/tools/build-tool/data/android/integrated-services/read_external_storage/README.md">read_external_storage service</a> to be able to read storage files (e.g. from SD card)
through the <code>file</code> protocol.

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>This protocol should be used to load
<a href="data">data files</a> of your project.
During development, on normal desktop systems (Windows, Linux etc.),
the <i>data files</i> are simply files
inside the <code>data</code> subdirectory of your project.
You should place there all the files loaded at runtime by your application.

<p>When the application is packaged for some systems,
like Android or iOS, the data directory may be treated in a special way.
If you access all the data files using the <code>castle-data</code> protocol
(or using URLs relative to files loaded using the <code>castle-data</code> protocol)
then your application will "just wok" on all systems.

<p>See the <a href="data">documentation
about the data directory</a>.

<p>Note that you can adjust
<?php echo cgeRef('ApplicationDataOverride'); ?>
 to host your data files wherever you want.
This way data files may even be loaded from <code>http</code> location.
On desktop systems, the data location is by default
just a regular directory on disk, but you can change it.

<!--
The castle-data:/ URL designates files inside the application data directory. When developing, this is usually the subdirectory "data/" of your project. When the application is installed, this is sometimes a special directory within the filesystem, sometimes a special filesystem (read-only "assets" on Android). Use this for all your game's URLs to have a completely self-contained game that will work on any OS.

When setting the URLs of various components from Lazarus, by clicking on "..." in the Lazarus Object Inspector, we automatically detect when you chose a file inside the "data/" subdirectory, and change the URL into appropriate castle-data:/ (instead of a file:/ URL).
-->

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p><code>http</code> and <code>https</code> work.
You can download data from the Internet,
and the <?php echo cgeRef('TCastleDownload'); ?>
 has a support for various HTTP methods (GET, POST).
You can use this for simple downloading, or for full-featured communication with a REST
server.

<p>Asynchronous <?php echo cgeRef('TCastleDownload'); ?>
 supports <code>http</code> and <code>https</code> automatically.
It is perfect to use with unreliable / slow network.

<p>Synchronous <?php echo cgeRef('Download'); ?>
 supports these protocols only if you set global variable
 <?php echo cgeRef('EnableBlockingDownloads'); ?>
 to <code>true</code>.
We call them "blocking downloads" because the application has to simply wait for
the download to finish and there's no way to interrupt the download
(without just killing the application) or even watch the progress.
<!--So these "blocking downloads" are easy to use from code,
but may cause your application to hang,
as network may be slow / unreliable.-->
We advise always using <?php echo cgeRef('TCastleDownload'); ?>
 to get data from the network &mdash; although it requires
 a bit more effort from code, but allows to observe and interrupt the download.

<p>For the <code>https</code> (encrypted version of <code>http</code>) protocol to work:

<ol>
  <!--
    // CGE now requires FPC >= 3.2.0
    li><p>You need to use FPC &gt;= 3.2.0. Older FPC versions have critical problem with this.
  -->

  <li><p>For FPC: Use the <code>OpenSSLSockets</code> unit. Simply add this to the uses clause
    of one of your units (like <code>GameInitialize</code>):

    <pre>{$ifdef FPC} OpenSSLSockets, {$endif} // support HTTPS</pre>

  <li><p>Make sure users have the OpenSSL library installed.

    <p>On Unix (Linux, FreeBSD, macOS...), it is standard to have OpenSSL
    installed already system-wide. Developers and users likely don't need to do
    anything.

    <p>On Windows, use the appropriate DLLs.
    Our <a href="editor">editor</a> (or command-line <a href="build_tool">build tool</a>)
    will automatically place the proper DLLs alongside your EXE file on the first build.
    You only need to add <code>&lt;dependency name="Https" /&gt;</code> in your
    <a href="project_manifest">CastleEngineManifest.xml</a>.
</ol>

<p>See an example like
<a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/network/asynchronous_download/">examples/network/asynchronous_download/</a>
that does both things above, to make <code>https</code> work.

<p>Note that we use URLs, not filenames, throughout the entire engine API.
So to load something from the network, you can just pass e.g. <code>https://...</code>
to <?php echo cgeRef('TCastleSceneCore.Load'); ?>.

<p>Inside models (like X3D, glTF and other), you can also refer to network resources,
and it will "just work".
For example you can use X3D <code>Inline</code> node to inline a model from given URL,
you can use X3D <code>Anchor</code> node to switch to given model on click,
you can refer to textures and sounds and scripts and everything else
from the network. Relative URLs are always resolved
with respect to the containing document.

<p><i>On Android</i>, you should use the <a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/tools/build-tool/data/android/integrated-services/download_urls/README.md">download_urls service</a> to support <code>http</code> and <code>https</code> protocols.

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p><code>data</code> is a special protocol that doesn't refer to
an external resource. Instead, the complete data URI <i>contains</i> the contents.
<!-- (yes, it's often quite long, longer than normal URLs). -->
This allows to embed various resources
(like textures, sounds, other 3D models) inside a parent file.
For example instead of referring to the texture filename from 3D model &mdash;
you can embed the actual texture contents inside 3D model file.
This is sometimes a very nice feature (it makes the file easier to distribute).

<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme">data: URI specification</a>.
Our engine includes a tool <code>to-data-uri</code> that can turn any file
into a data URI, and you can use such data URI everywhere where we expect URL.
<code>to-data-uri</code> is <a href="https://castle-engine.io/">provided
in the regular engine download in the <code>bin/</code> subdirectory</a>, also
<a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/tools/to-data-uri/to-data-uri.lpr">source code is here</a>.

<p>Wherever our engine, or X3D, says that it expects a URL &mdash; you can use data URI
to provide the contents "right there", without using any additional file.
<!-- You can say that the data URI is "self-contained". -->

<p>Demos of using data URI are inside <?php
echo a_href_page('our demo models', 'demo_models'); ?>,
see in particular <a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/demo-models/blob/master/x3d/data_uri.x3dv">x3d/data_uri.x3dv</a>.

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>You can open and register an arbitrary ZIP file to read / write resources from it using a custom URL. See the <?php echo cgeRef('TCastleZip.RegisterUrlProtocol'); ?> docs.

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/network/custom_url_handler">examples/network/custom_url_handler</a>, when <code>USE_ZIP_URL_HANDLER</code> is defined.

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>You are not limited to the protocols documented here. You can register your own URL protocols, with custom reading and writing handlers, using <?php echo cgeRef('RegisterUrlProtocol'); ?>.

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/network/custom_url_handler">examples/network/custom_url_handler</a>, when <code>USE_ZIP_URL_HANDLER</code> is undefined.


<?php
//echo $toc->html_section();

/*

<p>This protocol is called <code>castle-android-assets</code> or (deprecated name) <code>assets</code>. It is only available on Android.

<p>Used to access data files in an Android application.
"Asset" files live inside your application's .apk file, together with your compiled game.
The <a href="build_tool">build tool</a>
will copy the <code>data</code> directory of your game to Android assets.
For example, file that was in <code>data/my_texture.png</code> in your source code
can be accessed (from the Android app) using the URL <code>assets:/my_texture.png</code>.

<p><i>You should never explicitly use this protocol name</i>,
as it does not work on other platforms than Android.
Instead, use < ?php echo cgeRef('ApplicationData'); ? >
 to refer to your data files from code. The
< ?php echo cgeRef('ApplicationData'); ? >
 will always return an absolute URL to the data file location on current platform.
On Android it will start with <code>castle-android-assets:/...</code> but you should treat this
as an internal detail.

<!--
Inside your data, when referring from one data file to another,
e.g. when an 3D file refers to a texture,
use relative URLs.
-->

<!--
<p>Usage of <code>assets:/</code> protocol to access Android assets by URLs is
consistent <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtdoc/platform-notes-android.html#assets-file-system">at least with Qt</a>.
See also <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/index.html">Android
docs for more information about assets and project layout</a>.
-->

?>

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p>If you use
<?php echo cgeRef('TCastleWindow'); ?>,
it gives you a ready
<?php echo cgeRef('TCastleWindow.FileDialog'); ?>
 that takes and returns URLs.

<p>If you use Lazarus with
<?php echo cgeRef('TCastleControl'); ?>,
we advise to use our dialog components:
<?php echo cgeRef('TCastleOpenDialog'); ?>,
<?php echo cgeRef('TCastleSaveDialog'); ?>,
<?php echo cgeRef('TCastleOpenSceneDialog'); ?>,
<?php echo cgeRef('TCastleOpenImageDialog'); ?>,
<?php echo cgeRef('TCastleSaveImageDialog'); ?>.
They expose <code>URL</code> property which works naturally with CGE.

<!--
You can also continue using standard Lazarus dialog components.
Our routines (almost) always handle a filename instead of an URL,
or you can explicitly convert between filenames and URLs using functions
mentioned earlier.
-->

<?php echo $toc->html_section(); ?>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier">URI</a>
is a more general term. URI uniquely identifies a resource but does not
necessarily tell us how to load (download) or save (upload) it.
We have many routines in <?php echo cgeRef('CastleUriUtils'); ?>
 unit that process URIs (strings), they use the more general term <code>URI</code>.
They complement standard FPC <code>URIParser</code> routines.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator">URL</a>
is a specific type of URI that also tells you how to load or save the resource.
For example <code>http</code> and <code>file</code> protocols define URLs.
Most of our routines that load or save use the term <code>URL</code>.

<p>Things get a little more cloudy when you realize there's also
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme">data URI scheme</a>.
It's not precisely an URL (it's not an address of a resource),
but you <i>can</i> load it (since the URI itself contains the resource).
And we support it fully (our
<?php echo cgeRef('Download'); ?> method
loads it automatically). Admittedly, this means that our loading routines
should rather use the term <i>URL or data URI</i>, but that's just long
and (for those who don't use data URI) confusing, so for simplicity we
just keep (over-)using the term <i>URL</i>. Also, other standards (like CSS
and X3D) allow placing <i>data URIs</i> inside fields called <code>url</code>.

<p>If you enjoy reading about Internet terminology,
note that we use in our engine also
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_name">URNs</a>
(another subtype of URI). They are used by X3D external prototypes,
see <?php echo a_href_page('X3D extensions introduction', 'x3d_extensions'); ?>.
