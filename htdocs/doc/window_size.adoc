:description: Configure window size and fullscreen mode.

## Introduction

By default, _Castle Game Engine_ applications using cgeref:TCastleWindow[] run in a window with reasonable size (initialized to take 4/5 of the screen size) centered on the screen.This default is nice to test your application. For example, you can easily resize the window and test that link:data_settings[UI scaling] works properly.
// (size of everything changes properly and things are anchored to proper sides).

You can change the window size and mode, e.g. if you want to run your application in a fullscreen mode by default.

Do this by setting the window properties that control window size and mode:

- cgeref:TCastleWindow.FullScreen[]
- cgeref:TCastleWindow.Width[]
- cgeref:TCastleWindow.Height[]
- cgeref:TCastleWindow.Left[]
- cgeref:TCastleWindow.Top[]
- cgeref:TCastleWindow.AntiAliasing[] (this property is not directly related to window size, but it's a good idea to consider and adjust it at the same time)

You have to adjust these properties before the window is opened. In the standard case, this means that you should change them in the `initialization` section of some unit, like `code/gameinitialize.pas`. Our standard project templates put there a comment saying `Optionally, adjust window fullscreen mode and size at this point` to make it easy.

// If you follow the standard cross-platform project template, then the window is opened on desktop from the auto-generated main program file (that does `Application.MainWindow.OpenAndRun`) and on other platforms, it is opened automatically by system and managed by the engine.

## Make window fullscreen

Just use this:

```pascal
Window.FullScreen := true;
```

This makes the window fullscreen, using the current screen resolution. We recommend to use this for production games, as it is the most common way to run games.

## Set window size

[WARNING]
====
When writing cross-platform applications, note that you don't have full control over the window size and mode.

- On mobile, the application "window" will generally just match the device.

- On link:web[], user has always the ability to resize the canvas by scaling the page.

- On desktops, while it is possible to prevent _some_ user actions by setting cgeref:TCastleWindow.ResizeAllowed[] to cgeref:raNotAllowed[], some window systems allow users to resize anyway and/or toggle the fullscreen mode.

- On consoles, only specific screen sizes may be available.

The general conclusion is: we recommend to make sure your application works well in any window size, and not to rely on a specific window size or fullscreen mode.
====

Bearing in mind the above warning, if you want to _try_ setting the window size to something "hardcoded", use this:

```pascal
Window.FullScreen := false; // this is default, but still we can say it explicitly
Window.Width := 600;
Window.Height := 400;
```

However, "hardcoding" the window size (as shown above) is not recommended. Even disregarding the above warning ("you don't have full control over the window size"), it is not a good idea because you don't know how it will look on different users' screens. Users have monitors with very different resolutions, and a size that looks good for you may be too small (or too large) for them.

It's better to calculate window size based on the screen size. For example, run in a window taking 2/3 of screen (width and height):

```pascal
Window.FullScreen := false; // default
Window.Width := Application.ScreenWidth * 2 div 3;
Window.Height := Application.ScreenHeight * 2 div 3;
```

It's sometimes nice to have a window with a specific aspect ratio, e.g. portrait with aspect ratio 900x1600. You can do this by setting one dimension (like `Window.Width`) based on the screen, and then adjust the other dimension (like `Window.Height`) to achieve the desired aspect ratio:

```pascal
Window.FullScreen := false; // default
Window.Width := Application.ScreenWidth div 3; // 1 / 3 of screen width
Window.Height := Window.Width * 1600 div 900; // 16:9 aspect ratio
```

## Anti-aliasing

While adjusting the window size or fullscreen mode, you may also want to enable _anti-aliasing_. Anti-aliasing makes graphics appear smoother, especially along the edges of 3D objects, reducing the "jagged" look. Enabling it is straightforward: set the cgeref:TCastleWindow.AntiAliasing[] property before the window is opened (typically at the same time you set the window size):

```pascal
Window.AntiAliasing := aa4SamplesNicer;
```

See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/3d_games/walking_adventure/code/gameinitialize.pas#L71[real-life example here], it's really that simple.

[#video_change]
## Changing the physical screen resolution (not recommended)

We have API to change the physical screen resolution using cgeref:TCastleApplication.TryVideoChange[Application.TryVideoChange]. Test and follow the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/user_interface/screen_resolution_change/[examples/user_interface/screen_resolution_change] example.

However, there's a big warning here.

In short: **Avoid changing the physical screen resolution**.

Reasons:

1. It is not a nice user experience (despite many games offering this feature):
+
--
- _Alt+Tab_ between the game and other applications means that system either needs to change resolutions (delay and blinking when _Alt+Tab_), or shows other applications in non-standard resolution.

- It is easy to leave system with non-default resolution upon application exit, by mistake. Or when the game crashes.

// OSes don’t really give us a reliable API to say _"I want my application to work with different screen resolution, do it and handle the rest of applications / desktop reliably_. In case of Windows (using WinAPI) the capabilities are a bit better but not perfect (but at least the resolution we request is tied to our application and sometimes it reverts back OK), on Linux (XF86VMode of Xlib) it’s a bit worse (we have to manually restore the resolution, which requires us to track application change/close carefully). In neither case it’s really perfect.
// We could confirm above also with games made with other engines. Switching resolution in games (that change the physical screen resolution) and alt+tabbing between applications is risky, you’re not sure when the resolution will change/revert.
// https://forum.castle-engine.io/t/suggestion-fullscreen-resolution-trouble/1888/5

- It is up to the monitor how it handles resolutions that are allowed, but do not match the optimal monitor resolution. The display may be stretched non-uniformly or show black borders.

- We're not alone in this recommendation. E.g. https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/rendering/multiple_resolutions.html[Godot Game Engine] has similar notes discouraging changing resolution.
--

2. It is not implemented everywhere in our engine (which is, in part, because we don't recommend it...).
+
It is right now implemented only for WinAPI (default link:castlewindow_backends[backend of TCastleWindow on Windows]) and Xlib (non-default link:castlewindow_backends[backend of TCastleWindow on Unix]). For some platforms, like mobile or web, it is impossible.
+
Moreover, we miss an API like `EnumerateScreenConfigurations` right now, to show to a user a list of available resolutions that matches user's possible resolution. Note that it would be monitor-specific for multi-monitor setups, so to implement it, we need to introduce an API to enumerate screens and choose the screen for the window too.

If you want is to design a game that works on all possible resolutions then we recommend to just use our UI scaling. This is configurable in `CastleSettings.xml`. See link:data_settings[UI scaling and CastleSettings.xml docs]. It doesn't require changing the physical screen resolution, yet allows you to design your game for a particular resolution and it will look good everywhere.
