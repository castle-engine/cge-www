== Rendering Skyboxes and Static Cube Environment Maps

You can render a set of six images that can be used as a skybox (`Background` in X3D, see link:x3d_implementation_environmentaleffects.php[documentation of the _Environmental effects component_]) or a cube map texture (`ComposedCubeMapTexture` in X3D, see link:x3d_implementation_cubemaptexturing.php[documentation of the _Cube map environmental texturing component_]). We have a small Python script for Blender that renders the images to the appropriate names following the X3D conventions (front, back, top,....), and a simple X3D test scenes that allow to test that the resulting images indeed work as a skybox or a cubemap texture (e.g. you can open them in castle-model-viewer).
