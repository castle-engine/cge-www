== Overview

_"The Castle"_ is a first-person shooter style game in a dark fantasy setting. Your main weapon is a sword, so the fight is mostly short-range. 3 main levels included, packed with creatures, items and sounds.

Also a couple of bonus levels are available, for fun and to show off some engine features. In particular, there's the classic DOOM E1M1 level -- I know you always wanted to have a sword and a bow in DOOM :) Enjoy!

////
Requirements to run: At least 512 MB RAM is recommended.
Fast and stable OpenGL is also needed (read: good graphic card with up-to-date drivers).
The game was tested with various graphic cards and OpenGL implementations:
NVidia, Radeon with closed drivers from ATI and open-source ones,
Mesa OpenGL also works (although pure software Mesa will usually be too slow).
////

////
For a good graphic cards, you may decide to turn
Conserve memory to No. The game will eat much more
memory then (both in RAM and on graphic card), but you will have to
wait only once for "Loading creatures").
////

////
History and plans: This game is a little old now,
and it doesn't really use the capabilities of latest
Castle Game Engine versions.
This game was initially developed for PascalGameDevelopment
competition. It was at the beginning of 2006, at a time when
our engine didn't even have a version number yet :)
A new game, that actually uses the current capabilities
of our engine (we developed a lot of new features since 2006...), is planned.

== Installing

* *Windows:*
+
Extract the downloaded archive anywhere. Run the game by running `castle.exe`.
+
Note that from the game you will be able to choose various audio devices (see menu _Sound options_). I advice to check both devices. Under Windows _Generic Software_ device often sounds better than the default one. On the other hand, as far as I know, only _Generic Hardware_ can produce sound better than stereo, if you have more than 2 speakers.

* *Linux, FreeBSD:*
+
Installing actual game: extract the downloaded archive anywhere. Run the game by running the binary, like `./castle`.
+
To hear game sounds you should install link:openal#_installing_openal[OpenAL] and http://xiph.org/vorbis/[VorbisFile] libraries using your Linux distribution package manager.

* *macOS:*
+
Extract the archive, drag-and-drop the application wherever you like.
+
See link:macos[macOS dependencies] for more macOS information.

== WARNING: This is a game from 2006 and has some programmer art :)

Note that this game was done quite long time ago: it was done for http://pascalgamedevelopment.com/[PascalGameDevelopment] competition in 2006. I was tinkering with the code since then (the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-game/[source code from GitHub] compiles with https://castle-engine.io/download[latest Castle Game Engine]). But I never had time to actually rework the 3D levels and creatures to something prettier.

This is combined with the fact that the game graphics was composed by me (Michalis), a programmer, not an artist. I used various free 3D models, doing various adjustments and adding some simple own models.

So forgive 3D graphics that look quite dated now :)

You want to see something pretty? Check out https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/3d_games/explore_impressive_castle[examples/3d_games/explore_impressive_castle] in CGE sources! This was done by real artists, and in 2022, and it looks amazing :)

== Movie

Short gameplay sequence and playing around with shadow volumes. Note that this was done with quite old engine version, in new version more things cast shadows.

*Spoiler alert*: the first half of the movie shows levels you will see later in the game.
