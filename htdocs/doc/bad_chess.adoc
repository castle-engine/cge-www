We present two tutorial articles that introduce the _Castle Game Engine_. Highly recommended reading!

1. https://castle-engine.io/bad-chess/castle_game_engine_bad_chess_1.html[Installation, editor, designing a 3D world, views, testing physics]
(https://castle-engine.io/bad-chess/castle_game_engine_bad_chess_1.pdf[PDF version, 22 pages])
(https://jorgeturiel.es/?p=723[Spanish translation])

2. https://castle-engine.io/bad-chess/castle_game_engine_bad_chess_2.html[Coding using Pascal and engine API, behaviors, selection and hover, reusing a design of a 3D object] (https://castle-engine.io/bad-chess/castle_game_engine_bad_chess_2.pdf[PDF version, 33 pages])
(https://jorgeturiel.es/?p=760[Spanish translation])

These articles assume zero initial engine knowledge.
They go through all most important aspects of our engine.
All the techniques discussed are recommended ways to use the engine, they are proven to be comfortable and flexible for a wide range of games, and we work on keeping them optimal. The article and examples are suitable for both FPC and Delphi developers.
// -- explaining everything, including editor usage and Pascal coding, resulting in a complete... game, or at least a fun toy :) The _"bad way to play chess"_ is our little joke, really just an excuse to design a 3D physics-based game.

If you want to play a ready game, https://castle-engine.itch.io/bad-chess[download and install it from here (ready binaries for Linux and Windows)].
