# Build Tool
include::common.adoc[]

== Introduction

Together with the engine we include a tool to help with building and packaging your programs for various platforms (standalone, mobile, consoles...).

Just https://castle-engine.io/[download Castle Game Engine] and the build tool is included inside.

In most cases, you will use https://castle-engine.io/manual_editor.php[Castle Game Engine Editor] (`bin/castle-editor` executable) that automatically uses build tool described here, under the hood. Alternatively, you can execute the build tool directly, on the command-line, using `bin/castle-engin` executable.

== Command-line Usage

Open a terminal (command-line), and enter the directory containing `CastleEngineManifest.xml` file. This is the main project directory.

Run this command to compile the project (for the current operating system and processor):

----
castle-engine compile
----

Run this to compile and also package (again, for the current operating system and processor):

----
castle-engine package
----

By default we compile in release mode. Use option `--mode=debug` to compile a debug version (slower, but more friendly for various debuggers).

That's it, you can now use our "build tool" to easily compile and package your games for various platforms:) Read on to learn about more useful commands of the build tool.

== Creating and using the manifest file for your projects

You need a `CastleEngineManifest.xml` file in your project's directory. See the link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml examples] page for samples and documentation. The *manifest file describes your project's name, source code*, what files to include in the package and such.

In most cases, the starting contents of the `CastleEngineManifest.xml` file will be created when creating the project. You can use link:editor[editor] to create a new project or build tool `castle-engine create ...` command.

Once you have a project, *call `castle-engine` from within your project's directory* (or any subdirectory, we automatically look for `CastleEngineManifest.xml` in parent directories) *to quickly compile, package or clean the project*. See the description of command-line parameters to `castle-engine` below. The tool is integrated with our engine, so it can automatically compile the code correctly, and package it following our usual conventions. The data for the game is automatically packaged. On Windows the required DLL files are automatically included (see also the description of <dependencies> in link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml]). On Android the required Java wrappers and libraries are automatically used.

////
Commented out, as this is already covered by link:data[]:

Special file/directory names:

* The `data` subdirectory of the project, if found, is used for game data. It is automatically included in the game package for all platforms. It is accessible at runtime using URLs like `castle-data:/xxx.png` function (see the link:data[manual about data directory]).
+
We filter out some common development files like `*.xcf` and `*.blend*` from the data. See also <include> and <exclude> directives (in link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml]) to add/remove specific files from the package. These allow to add/remove files both inside and outside of data.

* The `data/material_properties.xml` file, if found, is assumed to be used for https://castle-engine.io/creating_data_auto_generated_textures.php[material properties configuration]. The subcommand `castle-engine auto-generate-textures` will use it to know which textures should be compressed and downscaled. At runtime, load this file to MaterialProperties.URL to actually use the compressed and downscaled versions.

////

////
Commented out, as this is too verbose and unnecessary:

Note that _using the build tool is optional_. The https://castle-engine.io/[Castle Game Engine] is just a set of Object Pascal units. You can use them in your programs, and compile/package the final program/library however you like. You can directly use Lazarus or command-line FPC to compile your game, and it's a sufficient approach when you develop a standalone game -- since the compiler generates a working executable that you simply run. And you can distribute it however you like.

However, using the build tool is nice to automate some tasks. For example, in case of Android and iOS, "building and packaging" is not a trivial process -- after compiling there are some steps you have to follow to get a final package that you can distribute to install/run your program. The build tool does it for you automatically, *for example it can create fully-working Android apk/aab, you only provide your Pascal source code*.

Main advantages of using the build tool:

* It can trivially easy package your game for Android. Once your code compiles for Android, packaging it to a production-ready file (APK or AAB) file (that you can distribute freely, e.g. upload on Google Play) is trivial. Just call `castle-engine package --target=android`.
// It can also package to a debuggable apk, that can be inspected with debuggers based on "gdb". Commented out, ndk-gdb is not 100% reliable anymore.
* It can trivially easy package your game for iOS. Just call `castle-engine package --target=ios`, and then open the created project in Xcode (to run it in simulator, publish...). You can also use `--package-format=ios-archive-xxx` arguments to create IPA file.
* It also takes care of resources (with icon, version information, manifest) on Windows.
* It can also compile and package your game for desktop operating systems like Linux and Windows. This is comfortable, making sure that the same compilation options and the same packaging rules (what to include / what to exclude) are used when packaging your game for all targets.

== Commands supported by the castle-engine tool

=== create

Create a new project. Provide the project name as a required parameter, like this:

```shell
castle-engine create new-project-name
```

The `new-project-name` determines a few things:

- It is the project name set in link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml].
- Thus is determines various output file names (e.g. executable name).
- It also determines the directory name where the project will be placed.

There are also optional parameters:

--project-template TEMPLATE-NAME::
Use the given template to create the project. Available template names correspond to subdirectories of https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/tools/castle-editor/data/project_templates[project_templates] in engine, right now they are:

- `empty` (default) - an empty project, with a view that just shows FPS, nothing else.
- `2d_game` - a simple 2D game.
- `3d_fps_game` - a simple 3D first-person shooter game.
- `3d_model_viewer` - a 3D model viewer.

--project-parent-dir PARENT-DIR::
By default subdirectory `new-project-name` will be created in the current directory. Use this option to specify a different directory.

--project-caption::
The project caption set in link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml]. This is a human-readable name of the project, shown in various places by default (window title, application icon on mobile desktops...). Default is equal to project name.

--project-main-view::
Name of the initial design and Pascal unit. Affects only some templates (`empty`, `3d_model_viewer` for now). Default just `Main`.

NOTE: At the end, this command also generates program files just like the `generate-program` command. So there's no point in calling `generate-program` right after `create`.

=== compile

Compile the project, with the syntax options and optimizations suggested for programs using our engine.

By default we compile for your current OS (operating system) and processor, so if you're on 32-bit Windows \-> you will compile a 32-bit Windows binary, if you're on 64-bit Linux \-> you will compile a 64-bit Linux binary and so on. You can use `--os` and/or `--cpu` options to cross-compile. Underneath, proper cross-compilation options will be passed to FPC.

For example:

* Call `castle-engine compile --cpu=x86_64` to compile a 64-bit version for the current operating system.
* Call `castle-engine compile --os=linux --cpu=x86_64` to compile a 64-bit version for Linux.
* Windows is a little weird (due to historical conventions beyond FPC), and you have to use `castle-engine compile --os=win64 --cpu=x86_64` (thus, you request 64-bit "twice" in the command-line) to get a 64-bit version on Windows. Use `castle-engine compile --os=win32 --cpu=i386` to get a 32-bit executable for Windows.

Instead of `--os` and/or `--cpu` options, you can also use `--target`. A _target_ is a collection of OS and CPU combinations that typically are distributed together. Right now, these targets are available:

. `custom` (the default target), which means that we look at `--os` and/or `--cpu` options, and compile for this single OS/CPU.
. `android`, which consists of 2 combinations of OS/CPU: Android OS on ARM (32-bit) and Android on Aarch64 aka Arm64 (64-bit).
. `ios`. By default this consists of 2 combinations of OS/CPU, to include 32-bit and 64-bit iOS devices. Add the `--ios-simulator` option to include 2 more combinations of OS/CPU to include also support for the iOS simulator. See link:ios[iOS] to learn more.
. `nintendo-switch`, which builds an application for link:nintendo_switch[Nintendo Switch].
. `web` which builds for link:web[].

Use `--mode=debug` or `--mode=release` or `--mode=valgrind` for a specific compilation mode. By default, it is "release". The "valgrind" mode is for profiling (speed, memory usage) using the excellent http://valgrind.org/[Valgrind tool].

In all cases, your programs will be compiled with the same options as engine units. We turn the same optimizations as for the engine core. In FPC it which means that we use ObjFpc syntax mode by default.

By default we auto-detect the compiler: using the compiler indicated in link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml] by `compiler="xxx"` option, otherwise using FPC or Delphi (whichever first is found). You can use `--compiler` command-line option to override the compiler choice, like `--compiler=fpc` or `--compiler=delphi`.

You can customize what options we pass to the compiler by:

. Adding options to the `<custom_options>` in link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml]. This is the good place to define options specific to your project (that should be used by all developers working with this project).
. Using `--compiler-option` command-line option. For example, `--compiler-option=-dMY_DEFINE` or `--compiler-option=-gl --compiler-option=-gh`. This is the good place to pass options specific to your development system or preferences, that should not be shared by all developers working on this project.

Use `--output DIR` to place the output files (executable, temporary `castle-engine-output` subdirectory) in a specified directory. When not given, they are placed in the current project directory. This option is also available for other commands, like `package`, `install` and `run`.

Compiling on Windows will also copy the necessary `.dll` files from the engine to be alongside your `.exe` file. This allows to run the executable afterwards, in any way.

NOTE: This is not the only possible way to compile programs using our engine (for example, you can also compile and run using Lazarus, which is OK for desktop applications).

=== package

Create an installable package with your application.

Use `--cpu`, `--os` or `--target` options to specify target operating system/processor. By default, we package for current standalone platform.

Use `--compiler` to override compiler for building, just as for `compile` command.

What exactly is produced by this command depends on the target platform and the `--package-format` option used.

* `--package-format=default` (used also when no `+--package-format=...+` was specified):
 ** For the standalone platforms, we package to a simple `zip` / `tar.gz` archive containing the executable, libraries and data. For Windows, we create `zip`, otherwise `tar.gz`.
 ** For the Android, we create an `.apk` file with your application, ready to be installed on your device and distributed to testers.
+
This happens when you used `--target=android` or `--os=android --cpu=<any supported Android processor>` (processors supported by Android now are `arm`, `aarch64`, `x86_64`).
 ** For iOS (when `--target=ios`), we create an Xcode project, that you can run and publish using Xcode.
 ** For link:web[] (when `--target=web`), we create a zip archive with the files that should be served by the web server. These are the contents of `castle-engine-output/web/dist/` directory after compilation to the web.
* `--package-format=zip`: Pack files into a zip file.
* `--package-format=tar.gz`: Pack files into a tar.gz file.
* `--package-format=deb`: Pack files into a Debian Package (deb).
* `--package-format=directory`: Put files into a directory. This is useful if you plan to further process this directory, e.g. pack it with your own scripts.
* Android formats:
 ** `--package-format=android-apk`: Create an APK file. This is right now the equivalent to `--package-format=default` and it is just the default behavior when target/OS is Android. It's the standard way to build applications for Android. It also allows you to manually install the app on your Android device.
 ** `--package-format=android-app-bundle`: Create an https://developer.android.com/platform/technology/app-bundle[Android App Bundle (AAB)]. This is a new format recommended for submitting a release to _Google Play Store_. _Android App Bundle_ internally may contain multiple precompiled versions of the app and assets, and Google Play Store internally generates an installable APK for every specific user depending on user device configuration (such as Android version or screen resolution). AAB format is required to upload a project to the _Google Play Store_ now.
* iOS formats:
 ** `--package-format=ios-xcode-project`: Create the Xcode project. This is the default package method for iOS. You can open the resulting project in Xcode and build/deploy the application for iOS device or AppStore.
 ** `--package-format=ios-archive-ad-hoc`: Archive and export using the _ad-hoc_ method, which results in an IPA file of the application. To install on designated devices, upload to https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/tools/build-tool/data/ios/services/test_fairy/README.adoc[TestFairy] etc.
 ** `--package-format=ios-archive-development`: Archive and export using the _development_ method. See the Xcode documentation (and try these options from Xcode interactively) for details.
 ** `--package-format=ios-archive-app-store`: Archive and export for the TestFlight and the AppStore. See the Xcode documentation (and try these options from Xcode interactively) for details. Note that this does not upload to the TestFlight / AppStore (although we'd like to extend this someday to do it).
* macOS formats:
 ** `--package-format=mac-app-bundle-zip`: Application bundle on macOS, packed into `zip`. Default format for link:macos[macOS].
 ** `--package-format=mac-app-bundle`: Application bundle on macOS, not packed (so it is just a directory like `MyApplication.app`).
* link:web[] formats:
 ** `--package-format=web-zip-dist`: Pack the `castle-engine-output/web/dist/` directory into a zip file. These files should be served by the web server.
* link:nintendo_switch[Nintendo Switch] format: `--package-format=nintendo-switch`.

When target is `iOS` you can also use `--ios-simulator` option to include iOS simulator support (see link:ios[iOS]).

By default output filename contains a version number. Sometimes this is not comfortable, use `--package-name-no-version` to avoid it.

You can use `--mode=xxx` option when packaging, just like when compiling. Use `--mode=debug` or `--mode=release` for a specific compilation mode. By default, it is "release". You can use `--mode=debug` to package a debug release, which may be useful to distribute to users interested in beta-testing.

In some cases, the `--mode` also affects the packaging wrapper. For example, on Android, a _debug apk_ is generated. Also, only a _debug apk_ may use a debug signing key (our build tool will automatically fallback from _release apk_ to _debug apk_ if you did not provide a https://castle-engine.io/android-FAQ#signing-a-release-apk[release key in AndroidSigningProperties.txt]).

To make sure that we recompile everything in the current mode (e.g. a _release mode_), this does `clean`, and then `compile`, and only then actually packages the result. You can change this behavior:

* Use `--fast` to make the compilation step faster -- we will recompile only what changed.
+
By default, without `--fast`, the `package` command first cleans all the compilation results, and then builds from scratch (engine and your code). This is safest (makes sure that everything is rebuild with latest compilation options) but slow, and usually not necessary (Pascal compilers are generally excellent at detecting what needs to be recompiled, FPC even handles changes to include files reliably). For the final release builds, we advise to not use this option.
+
Using `--fast` is suitable during the development, if you call the `package` command often.

* Use `--assume-compiled` to say that you already compiled the application in proper mode before calling the `package` action. We will not do `clean` and `compile` in this case at all. This is obviously much faster, but you need to make sure to call `compile` beforehand yourself.

Another (independent) way to make packaging faster is to use `--update-only-code`. _For now this is meaningful only for iOS._  If specified, it means that the build tool can assume that _only the Pascal code have changed_ (so you did not change e.g. `data/` directory, or project settings in `CastleEngineManifest.xml`). We can then recompile the code (and update the relevant file in the project, like `libxxx.a`) without changing anything else. This means that the `package` command will finish much faster. It will also be more comfortable -- e.g. no need to close and reopen the project in Xcode, Visual Studio or whatever other software is used to handle the final project.

=== install

Install the application created by the previous `package` command.

Right now this is useful only on Android. So typically you use the `install` command together with `--target=android`, like this:

```
castle-engine --target=android install
```

This installs the `.apk` file, which should have been made by executing `package` before this. Useful for testing on an Android device connected through USB, or paired over Wi-Fi, or on emulated device. You can use https://developer.android.com/studio[Android Studio] to manage _Android Virtual Devices_ and pair real devices over Wi-Fi.

NOTE: It's recommended to first test is your device detected. Use `castle-engine devices` and see if your device is listed.

You can pass also additional options reflecting the OS/CPU, mode and package name format. In general, pass to `install` _exactly_ the same values as you used for `package`, so that we know which package to install:

* Use `--os`, `--cpu` or `--target` to specify target operating system/processor (by default, we install for the current standalone platform, which will likely fail -- as `install` supports only Android).
* Use `--mode=xxx` to specify debug or release package.
* Use `--package-format`, `--package-name-no-version` to determine the package name.

NOTE: Instead of `--target=android`, you can also use `--os=android --cpu=<any supported Android processor>` to target only a specific Android CPU. Processors supported by Android now are `arm`, `aarch64`, `x86_64`.

=== uninstall

Uninstall the application installed by the previous `install` call.

Just like `install`, this is useful only on Android.

NOTE: You usually do not need to use this, as `install` automatically overwrites the previous installation, if only it was installed with the same key.

=== devices

List connected devices.

Right now, this is just a simple wrapper for calling `adb devices`, using the `adb` tool from the Android SDK. It lists all Android devices connected through USB, paired over Wi-Fi, or running Android Virtual Devices. Use the _Android Studio_ to manage the Android Virtual Devices and pair real devices over Wi-Fi.

=== run

Run the application.

The log of the application (whatever you write using link:log[WritelnLog, WritelnWarning]) will be the output of this command. On some platforms, you can also use regular `Writeln`, but to be cross-platform better stick to CGE `WritelnLog` / `WritelnWarning`, they will work in all cases (Android, iOS, Windows GUI applications etc.).

As usual, use `--os`, `--cpu` or `--target` options to specify target operating system/processor. By default, we run the normal (exe) application on the current platform.

On some platforms, it requires packaging and installing the application first. This applies to Android: we install and run on a device connected through USB. Use the "package" and "install" commands before this. For example, on Android you can package and install and run your application like this:

----
castle-engine package --target=android
castle-engine install --target=android
castle-engine run --target=android
----

On other platforms (e.g. standalone Windows, Linux, macOS...), this simply runs the last compiled application. So just "compile" the application first, like this:

----
castle-engine compile
castle-engine run
----

You can specify parameters to pass to the application after the special "--" parameter. For example,

----
castle-engine run -- --fullscreen
----

This will run your application with command-line parameters `--fullscreen`. In your application, you can read command-line parameters with the help of `CastleParameters` unit. (The `--fullscreen` option, used as an example here, is actually handled automatically, if only your program calls `Application.ParseStandardParameters`.) The command-line parameters are not supported in non-desktop environments (e.g. there's no way to pass them to an Android or iOS application).

On Unix desktop platforms (like Linux, FreeBSD..), we can run your game through a "wrapper script". This is useful e.g. to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` before running the application. The build tool simply looks for `run.sh` or `<application_name>_run.sh` script in the project directory, and executes it if found (instead of executing the compiled binary directly).

=== package-source

Package source code, which means just to package whole project directory (cleaned up first).

It creates xxx-VERSION-src.tar.gz archive, with VERSION obtained following the <version> element in the link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml].

It accepts the `--package-format` and `--package-name-no-version` options, just like the `package` command. By default we just pack to zip (that is, `--package-format=zip` is equivalent to `--package-format=zip`).

=== clean

Clean compilation and packaging temporary stuff. This does _not_ remove final packaging files.

=== simple-compile

Compile the Object Pascal file (unit/program/library) given as a parameter. This does not search for the Castle Game Engine project's manifest in the `CastleEngineManifest.xml` file. It merely calls "fpc" with proper command-line options for units/programs/libraries using our engine.

Use this instead of "compile" only if there's some good reason you don't want to use `CastleEngineManifest.xml` to manage your project.

=== auto-generate-textures

Create GPU-compressed versions of textures, and downscaled textures, for the textures mentioned in `<auto_generated_textures>` inside the file `data/material_properties.xml`. Such GPU-compressed and downscaled textures can then be automatically used in your application. See https://castle-engine.io/creating_data_auto_generated_textures.php[instructions how to use it and example `data/material_properties.xml`].

If the output textures are already created, they are updated only if the output timestamp is earlier than input. This usually allows to automatically do only the necessary work, similar to how Makefiles operate. To force recreating all textures, just call `castle-engine auto-generate-clean --all` first.

The information about created textures is stored in `data/CastleAutoGenerated.xml` file. If you use version control, you should either:

* ignore the `data/CastleAutoGenerated.xml` file and ignore all `auto_generated` directories.
* or commit both the `data/CastleAutoGenerated.xml` file and all `auto_generated` directories.

=== auto-generate-clean

Clear `auto_generated` subdirectories. They should contain only the output created by `castle-engine auto-generate-textures` target. In the future, it is possible that more things will be placed there (for example, modern GPUs allow mesh data compression).

Run without any arguments to only clean the _unused_ files in `auto_generated` subdirectories. This may be useful after moving/renaming some subdirectories, as the `castle-engine auto-generate-textures` command never removes previous files, it only adds new files. Having unused files is not a problem -- but they waste disk space, and can be safely removed.

Run with `--all` argument to clean _all_ files from the `auto_generated` subdirectories. This is useful e.g. if you want to force regenerating them all by next `castle-engine auto-generate-textures` command.

=== generate-program

Generates:

. _standalone (desktop) Pascal program code_ in the file `xxx_standalone.dpr`. It uses the `game_units` defined in the link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml] to determine the correct `uses` clause of the program file.
+
You can use this program code to compile the project using any tool you want, not necessarily our build tool. E.g. maybe you like using Lazarus or `fpmake`. You can use it as a `standalone_source` in the `CastleEngineManifest.xml` to make sure build tool also uses it (in case you will modify it), although build tool can also generate such source code automatically.
+
If the `standalone_source` is specified in link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml], then we overwrite it, regardless if it is called `xxx_standalone.dpr` or not.

. _Lazarus project information_ in the file `xxx_standalone.lpi`.
+
Together with `xxx_standalone.dpr`, this allows you to open this project in http://www.lazarus-ide.org/[Lazarus] to edit, compile, debug and run it from Lazarus. You can also compile it using `lazbuild`.
+
If the `standalone_source` is specified in link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml], then we overwrite the respective LPI file, regardless if it is called `xxx_standalone.lpi` or not.

. _Delphi project information_ in the file `xxx_standalone.dproj`.
+
Together with `xxx_standalone.dpr`, this allows you to open this project in https://www.embarcadero.com/products/Delphi[Delphi] to edit, compile, debug and run it from Delphi.
+
If the `standalone_source` is specified in link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml], then we overwrite the respective DPROJ file, regardless if it is called `xxx_standalone.dproj` or not.

. `CastleAutoGenerated` unit in `castleautogenerated.pas` unit. It is used by the program file created above (`xxx_standalone.dpr`) and also by all program or library files created automatically by the build tool to build project on all platforms. It defines some project properties, to parse standard command-line properties, to initialize logging.

=== editor

Run the _Castle Game Engine Editor_ within this project. The executed editor will include possible project-specific components.

* In simple cases, this is just a shortcut for running `castle-editor` and opening the current project, which can also be done by calling `castle-editor ../path-to-project/CastleEngineManifest.xml`.
* If your link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml] contains `editor_units` attribute, then this automatically builds and runs a custom CGE editor (a fork of the CGE editor, for use in your project), with your custom components included.
+
The custom editor is compiled and present inside `castle-engine-output/editor/`, so it is tied to your project, cleared with `castle-engine clean` and so on. You should always execute it using `castle-engine editor` command. Or using the _"Project \-> Restart Editor (may rebuild editor with custom controls)"_ menu from the CGE editor (vanilla build or custom build, doesn't matter, the "Restart editor" will always build custom editor if project uses `editor_units`).

=== cache

Precompile CGE units, to speed up future compilation of all projects (with the current compiler and engine version).

By default we prepare cache for compilation on the current platform. The options `--os`, `--cpu`, `--target` switch the platform, as usual. E.g. you can use `castle-engine cache --target android` to speedup future Android compilations.

The precompiled units are stored in user files, and will be reused by all subsequent compilations of any CGE project for matching platform. The precompiled units from cache are simply copied over (as a starting point) to your project's compilation directory. The precompiled units do not overwrite the existing ones, moreover the compiler *will* overwrite them (in the project) if e.g. you have changed CGE since making the cache. So the cache tries hard not to conflict with what you're doing.

The cache is always prepared for all possible modes: `debug`, `release`, `valgrind`. This command ignores the `--mode` option.

The `--compiler` option is taken into account, but for now for Delphi we merely answer with an error. The code to use cache is now only for FPC. In the future we plan to extend this to Delphi.

The `--ios-simulator` option is honored, it changes what `castle-engine cache --target=iOS` does (for what platforms does it prepare cache).

=== cache-clean

Remove all the cached files created by `cache` (for all platforms).

This reclaims the disk space used by cache and it implies that future compilations will be done without using the cache.

=== unused-data

Perform simple analysis of link:data[] files that are possibly _unused_ in your project.

If they are really unused, avoid packaging these files, to keep the application smaller to download for the user. To do this:

- Exclude them from being packaged. Note that files like `\*.blend*` are excluded by default.
- Move them out of `data` subdirectory (to some other project directory like `data-for-possible-future-usage`).
- Or just delete them. Because you use a _version control system_ and you are not afraid of removing things, right?

WARNING: Right now, this analysis is using some quick assumptions and heuristics. The data files are just _"grepped"_ (not intelligently analyzed) for the filenames they use. Do not trust this detection 100% -- sometimes files may be detected as used when they are not, or the other way around.

=== (Deprecated) create-manifest

Create link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml] file if it does not exist yet, guessing the project name based on directory name. You can use this `CastleEngineManifest.xml` as a starting point.

This is deprecated -- too little practical usage. Report if you find this useful.
