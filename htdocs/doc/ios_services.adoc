== How to use iOS services

Inside the link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml] you can declare which additional services you want to integrate with your iOS application. It looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<project name="castle_spine" game_units="GameInitialize">
  <ios>
    <services>
      <service name="apple_game_center" />
    </services>
  </ios>
</project>

== Services using CocoaPods

Some of the services use https://cocoapods.org/[CocoaPods] for installing 3rd-party dependencies easily (e.g. _Game Analytics_ or _Google Analytics_ or _Facebook SDK_ libraries).

In order to use such sevices:

. You need to have https://cocoapods.org/[CocoaPods] installed on your system. Just execute `sudo gem install cocoapods` in the terminal, it should make the `pod` command available on your `$PATH`.
+
The build tool will internally use `pod` to download and install service dependencies. This happens completely automatically. If you never used CocoaPods before, be aware that the 1st run may take a while (even a couple of minutes) as a large CocoaPods repository is downloaded.

. You should no longer open the project using `my_project_name.xcodeproj` file. This will not work, as the `+libPods...+` library will not be built in this case. Instead, open and run in Xcode the `my_project_name.xcworkspace` file (it is in the same directory as `my_project_name.xcodeproj`). Using this will correctly build and run the project with dependencies.

== Adding new services

Adding new iOS service is deliberately very consistent with creating new service for Android, which is documented on link:adding_new_android_services[Adding New Android Services].

* In case of iOS you write code using Objective-C.
* Similarly to Android, we have a base class in Objective-C `ServiceAbstract` with methods you can override, that correspond to typical iOS application lifecycle.
* See existing service code `build-tool/data/ios/services` for examples.
* Same as on Android, you can use `CastleMessaging` to communicate with Pascal code asynchronously.
* On iOS, use static libraries `libxxx.a` (instead of dynamic `libxxx.so`).
* Note that https://cocoapods.org/[CocoaPods] has a lot of common libraries available. You can trivially use `Podfile` inside a service to reference any library from CocoaPods. See e.g. https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/tools/build-tool/data/ios/services/freetype[freetype service on iOS] for an example.
