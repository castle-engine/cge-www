:description: Castle Game Engine supports KTX, Khronos Texture Format, for GPU-compressed textures, mipmaps, texture arrays and more.

== Introduction

In _Castle Game Engine_ we fully support KTX, https://www.khronos.org/ktx/[Khronos Texture Format].

There's nothing special you need to do to use KTX files in _Castle Game Engine_. Just load images in KTX format and display them as usual. Yo can refer to KTX image anywhere you would refer to an image (texture), e.g. you point to their URLs from cgeref:TCastleImageControl.Url[], cgeref:TCastleImageTransform.Url[], cgeref:TDrawableImage[], cgeref:TImageTextureNode[]. See link:using_images[using images] in the manual.

== Tooling

Our link:castle-image-viewer[Castle Image Viewer] supports KTX and allows to view each subimage of a KTX file.

We also have example utility https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/images_videos/image_decompose[image_decompose] that allows to extract all subimages from a KTX file.

You may find example KTX images inside our link:demo_models.php[demo models]. Also https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software[KTX-Software] has some samples (look in `tests` subdirectory).

== Features

KTX is an excellent image format with a number of graphic features useful when it comes to using it for textures and 3D:

- Can utilize GPU compression (images are compressed not only on disk, but also in GPU memory). We support these GPU-compressed formats in KTX:
+
--
- S3TC (DXT* formats, often available on desktops),
- ATITC (ATI compression, available on some mobile devices),
- PVRTC (PowerVR compression, available on some mobile devices),
- ETC1 (Ericsson compression, often available on mobile devices, but without alpha support).
- More compressed formats can be trivially added, just submit a link:https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/issues[bugreport] with a sample KTX file.
--

- Float-based formats are fully supported. When encountered, KTX files with float-based data will be read to engine float-based formats, and passed as floats to the GPU (so your shaders can enjoy data that has higher-precision and is not bounded to the [0, 1] range):
+
--
- cgeref:TGrayscaleFloatImage[],
- cgeref:TGrayscaleAlphaFloatImage[],
- cgeref:TRGBFloatImage[],
- cgeref:TRGBAlphaFloatImage[].
--

- 16-bit image formats are also supported, upon reading we will convert them to 32-bit float-based formats (so we waste memory, but we keep the precision).

- Textures can have explicit mipmaps (allows texture have better quality when viewer from far away).

- Volume (3D) textures.

- Configurable orientation of the image data in file. KTX data may be specified in _top-to-bottom_ or _bottom-to-top_ order. For 3D images, the slices can additionally be in _front-to-back_ or _back-to-front_ order. We support all these possibilities.

- Cube map can be stored -- this means that we effectively have 6 images (for skyboxes, reflections, etc.). TODO: We don't support cubemap yet, but we plan to add it. Submit a link:https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/issues[bugreport] with a sample KTX file to make it happen sooner!

- Both loading and saving of KTX files is implemented in _Castle Game Engine_.

- Reading certain KTX configurations is ultra-optimized, as their format matches precisely the format of image data in memory of the engine, which in turn matches the format expected by GPU.
+
When saving, we always use the optimized format, if only the padding matches. Almost always this results in ultra-optimized saving too.
+
To debug when the optimized writing / reading takes place, set the global variable `LogVerboseKtx` (from unit `CastleInternalCompositeImage`) to `true`.

We support KTX 1 right now. We plan to support KTX 2 (with https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_texture_basisu[KHR_texture_basisu]) in the future too.

== Example usage to speedup loading time: regenerate all your images to .ktx format

Read https://castle-engine.io/creating_data_auto_generated_textures.php[auto-generated textures documentation] to understand the idea of auto-generating textures to a different format/size/compression.

In short, you will need to execute `castle-engine auto-generate-textures` from the command-line, or use the _"Run -> Auto-Generate Textures"_ menu item in CGE editor.

Place this in `data/material_properties.xml`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<!--
Rules for automatic processing
(converting, compressing, downscaling, mipmap creation...) of images.
See https://castle-engine.io/creating_data_auto_generated_textures.php
-->

<properties>
  <!--
  Make not-compressed and not-downscaled version in castle-image format
  of images in textures/ .
  The castle-image format will load faster than anything else in CGE.
  -->
  <auto_generated_textures>
    <preferred_output_format extension=".ktx" />
    <trivial_uncompressed_convert />
    <include path="textures/*" recursive="True" />
  </auto_generated_textures>
</properties>
```

See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/quick-optimizations-walking-adventure/examples/3d_games/walking_adventure/data/material_properties.xml[usage in 3d_games/walking_adventure].

== Enumerating KTX subimages using Pascal

You can use https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/src/images/castleinternalcompositeimage.pas[CastleInternalCompositeImage] unit to load KTX files and explicitly iterate over subimages inside KTX. For example, to iterate over items in a texture array in KTX, for any purpose.

WARNING: As the name suggests, `CastleInternalCompositeImage` is an internal unit and its API may change arbitrarily in the future. Please link:talk.php[let us know] if you actually need this functionality and why -- at the very least, we will consider making it "official" (e.g. unit `CastleCompositeImage`) and we will put effort to not break its API.
