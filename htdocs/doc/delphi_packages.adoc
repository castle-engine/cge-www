Installing _Castle Game Engine_ packages in Delphi is necessary to link:control_on_form[register TCastleControl component, that you can drop on a VCL or FMX form].

## Installation in Delphi

- Open in Delphi `packages/delphi/AllPackages.groupproj`.

- Right-click on all packages (except `castle_engine_window.bpl`) in succession and click _"Install"_.

NOTE: The platform of all our packages is set by default to _"Windows 32-bit"_ and this is good, this is what you want to use for installation, since Delphi IDE is a Win32 application. The packages installed this way make CGE components available for all supported target platforms (including _Win32_, _Win64_, and _Linux64_).

## More information (for CGE developers)

More information about how and why CGE packages for Delphi are designed is in the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/packages/delphi/README.md[Delphi packages README file in sources].
