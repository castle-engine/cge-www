## Introduction

Installing _Castle Game Engine_ packages in Delphi is necessary to link:control_on_form[register TCastleControl component, that you can drop on a VCL or FMX form].

## Installation in Delphi

1. Open in Delphi `packages/delphi/AllPackages.groupproj`.

2. Right-click on all packages (except `castle_engine_window.bpl`) in succession and click _"Install"_.
+
NOTE: The platform of all our packages is set by default to _"Windows 32-bit"_ and this is good, this is what you want to use for installation, since Delphi IDE is a Win32 application. The packages installed this way make CGE components available for all supported target platforms (including _Win32_, _Win64_, and _Linux64_).

3. Use the new menu item _"Tools -> Castle Game Engine -> Set Engine Path..."_ to tell Delphi where is the CGE _root directory_.  It should contain subdirectories like `src`, `examples`. Don't worry, we validate what you select, we will not let you select an invalid directory.

4. Use the menu item _"Tools -> Castle Game Engine -> Configure Delphi to Use Engine"_. Restart Delphi IDE. (Restart is really necessary, as changing _"Library Path"_ in Delphi has to be done using the registry, and Delphi will load new values only on restart.)

## More information (for CGE developers)

More information about how and why CGE packages for Delphi are designed is in the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/packages/delphi/README.md[Delphi packages README file in sources].
