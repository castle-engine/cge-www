## Introduction

Installing _Castle Game Engine_ packages in Delphi is necessary to link:control_on_form[register TCastleControl component, that you can drop on a VCL or FMX form].

## Installation in Delphi

1. Open in Delphi `packages/delphi/AllPackages.groupproj`.

2. Right-click on all packages (except `castle_engine_window.bpl`) in succession and click _"Install"_.
+
NOTE: The platform of all our packages is set by default to _"Windows 32-bit"_ and this is good, this is what you want to use for installation, since Delphi IDE is a Win32 application. The packages installed this way make CGE components available for all supported target platforms (including _Win32_, _Win64_, and _Linux64_).

3. Use the new menu item _"Tools -> Castle Game Engine -> Set Engine Path..."_ to tell Delphi where is the CGE _root directory_.  It should contain subdirectories like `src`, `examples`. Don't worry, we validate what you select, we will not let you select an invalid directory.

4. Use the menu item _"Tools -> Castle Game Engine -> Configure Delphi to Use Engine"_.
+
Restart Delphi IDE, as adviced by the message that will appear.
+
NOTE: Restart is really necessary, as changing _"Library Path"_ in Delphi has to be done using the registry and Delphi will load new values only on restart.
+
This simply modifies the global _"Library Path"_ for all your Delphi platforms. You can visit _"Tools -> Options -> Language -> Delphi -> Library -> Library Path"_ (after restarting Delphi!) to see what it did. This way CGE source code is available to all your projects, and CGE units will be compiled and linked with your projects that use any `CastleXxx` units.

## More information (for CGE developers)

More information about how and why CGE packages for Delphi are designed is in the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/packages/delphi/README.md[Delphi packages README file in sources].

If you are interested in developing Delphi IDE extensions, you may find it useful to take a look at our test project https://github.com/michaliskambi/delphi-test-package-design-features . This is small, independent of CGE, piece of Pascal code demonstrating how to extend Delphi IDE -- adding new menu items, changing project and global options. We used it as a "test bed" to develop the CGE integration, and it may be useful for you too.
