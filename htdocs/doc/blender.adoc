:description: Export from Blender to glTF to use your models with Castle Game Engine.
:cge-social-share-image: blender_castle_1.png

== Introduction

http://www.blender.org/[Blender] is a magnificent free open-source modeling software.

You can use Blender to create 3D and 2D models, with animations, and export them to glTF.

== Exporting to glTF

Exporting from Blender to link:gltf[glTF 2.0] is the best way to use _Blender_ with _Castle Game Engine_.

* Export using the _File -> Export -> glTF 2.0_ menu item in Blender.

* Load the resulting file (in `.glb` or `.gltf` formats) to cgeref:TCastleScene[]. See manual about link:viewport_and_scenes[viewports and scenes].

* You can also open the glTF file with link:castle-model-viewer[Castle Model Viewer].

=== Important links

* link:https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/addons/import_export/scene_gltf2.html[Blender documentation of the glTF exporter] documents how to setup your models in Blender to export correctly to glTF.

// Too much info?
//* The exporter is link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-IO[developed by Khronos on GitHub].

* link:creating_data_model_formats.php#section_gltf[Details about Castle Game Engine support for glTF]. We support most glTF features, including physical materials and skinned animation.

=== Advised glTF export settings

* You usually want to check _"Geometry -> Apply Modifiers"_ in the export dialog.
* _"Remember Export Settings"_ is also usually useful.
* For typical games (where you distribute the game data with your application) we recommend exporting to _"glTF Separate (.gltf + .bin + textures)"_ variant.
+
Moreover select _"Keep Original"_ or edit the _"Textures"_ directory in the export dialog, so that glTF file will refer to your existing textures by relative filenames. In the simplest case, if your textures are already in the same directory as your glTF file, you don't need to do anything, _"glTF Separate (.gltf + .bin + textures)"_ will just use these textures.
+
This means that glTF file will only refer to your texture files. This allows to share textures between various models and keeps importing fast. It also allows to easily edit the textures in other applications, without the need to export glTF again.

=== Stashing animations

You may want to _Stash_ animations to have them reliably exported, as is briefly mentioned by link:https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/addons/import_export/scene_gltf2.html[exporter docs]. That is:

* go to _"Animation"_ view (or turn any Blender window into _"Dope Sheet"_)
* select _Armature_ (e.g. by left-clicking in 3D view)
* change _"Dope Sheet"_ mode to _"Action Editor"_
* select each animation (aka "action" in Blender) you want (repeat this for all animations you want to export)
* click _"Stash"_

=== Custom properties

cgeimg::float[blender_castle_collision_prop.png|Setting CastleCollision property in Blender]

Blender can export _Custom properties_ from various objects to glTF, and our engine reads them. You can access them by cgeref:TAbstractNode.MetadataString[MetadataString] and similar properties on X3D nodes. Demos:

* See link:https://github.com/castle-engine/demo-models[our demo-models], subdirectories `blender/custom_properties/` and `blender/custom_properties_2/`, for sample models.

* See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/short_api_samples/metadata/metadata_use.dpr[examples/short_api_samples/metadata/metadata_use.dpr] for sample Pascal code getting/setting metadata from Pascal.

Usage of custom properties:

* Custom properties on Blender materials are imported as metadata on X3D material nodes, like cgeref:TPhysicalMaterialNode[].
+
For example access them like:
+
[source,pascal]
----
MyString := MyMaterial.MetadataString['material_property_name'];
----

* Custom properties on Blender cameras are imported as metadata on X3D viewpoint nodes, like cgeref:TViewpointNode[].

* Custom properties on Blender meshes are imported as metadata on the _immediate parent `Group` of each X3D `Shape` node_. Note that many X3D shapes may be part of one Blender mesh.
+
For example, if you have a cgeref:TShapeNode[] instance, you can look at parent group by cgeref:TX3DNode.ParentFieldsNode[] property. To read metadata from the corresponding Blender mesh do this:
+
[source,pascal]
----
if MyShape.ParentFieldsCount = 1 then
  MyString := MyShape.ParentFieldsNode[0].MetadataString['mesh_property_name']
else
  WritelnWarning('Shape not created by glTF importer');
----

* Custom properties on Blender objects are imported as metadata on the _immediate parent `Transform` of each X3D `Group` representing Blender mesh_. Note that one Blender mesh may be part of multiple Blender objects.

=== Controlling if the shape is collidable in Castle Game Engine

We recognize a special property `CastleCollision` at Blender mesh. It sets link:x3d_implementation_shape_extensions.php#section_ext_shape_collision[X3DShapeNode.collision] field in X3D (cgeref:TAbstractShapeNode.Collision[] in Pascal API). It accepts the following values:

* `none` &mdash; non-collidable mesh.
* `box` &mdash; mesh collides as a simple axis-aligned box (auto-calculated from bounding box of the shape, unless link:x3d_implementation_shape_extensions.php#section_ext_shape_bbox[Shape.Bbox] is explicitly specified).
* `default` &mdash; mesh collides as a precise set of triangles.
