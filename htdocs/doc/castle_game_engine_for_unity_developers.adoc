== Introduction

If you come with a knowledge of another game engine, like _Unity_, this page will try to explain how some concepts map to _Castle Game Engine_. If you have any questions, remember to ask on https://forum.castle-engine.io/[forum], https://castle-engine.io/talk.php[Discord chat or other places].

== What is the equivalent of Unity `GameObject`?

`GameObject` in Unity is (simplifying) something that exists in your world, and may be visible, and may have children that are affected by a transformation.

For game objects (not user-interface), the closest equivalent of `GameObject` in _Castle Game Engine_ is the cgeref:TCastleTransform[] class. Instances of cgeref:TCastleTransform[] can be arranged in a hierarchy, where each element transforms (moves, rotates, scales) the children. The most important class of our engine is the cgeref:TCastleScene[], which is a descendant of cgeref:TCastleTransform[] that can actually render/animate/collide a model. Simply set cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.Url[TCastleScene.Url] to load your model (like a glTF file) there.

Our manual documents cgeref:TCastleScene[] and cgeref:TCastleTransform[] features in chapter link:viewport_and_scenes[Viewport with scenes, camera, navigation]. Basically you can do stuff like

[source,pascal]
----
MyScene.Url := 'castle-data:/my_model.gltf';
MyScene.Translation := Vector3(1, 2, 3);
MyScene.PlayAnimation('run', true);
----

The cgeref:TCastleTransform[] hierarchy is placed in a cgeref:TCastleViewport[], which is a 2D user-interface element (descendant of cgeref:TCastleUserInterface[]).

For objects that are user-interface elements, the most important base class is cgeref:TCastleUserInterface[]. It has many descendants, like

* obvious user interface controls: cgeref:TCastleButton[], cgeref:TCastleLabel[], cgeref:TCastleRectangleControl[], cgeref:TCastleImageControl[]...
* layouts: cgeref:TCastleVerticalGroup[], cgeref:TCastleHorizontalGroup[],
* and finally a critical UI component cgeref:TCastleViewport[] which is a "gateway" to actually render a hierarchy of cgeref:TCastleTransform[].

See link:user_interface[user interface] documentation.

== How to design a level composed from multiple assets, creatures etc.?

In the simplest case, for each 3D model, you create a cgeref:TCastleScene[] instance. You can do this visually, using the link:editor[editor], or from code.

To group (and transform as a group) a number of cgeref:TCastleScene[] instances you can use additional cgeref:TCastleTransform[] instances. The cgeref:TCastleScene[] is also a cgeref:TCastleTransform[] descendant, so it can have children too.

Follow the template _"3D FPS Game"_ (create it by running our editor, choose _"New Project"_ and then choose _"3D FPS Game"_ as a starting point). In the resulting project, open the design `data/gameviewplay.castle-user-interface` in the editor, to actually see what I mean (in this and previous answer).

Our goal with link:editor[CGE editor] is to provide an experience similar to Unity and other game engine editors. So you can drop 3D models on your design, and drag them to design a level.

== Where to place code for specific actors (like creatures, items)? What is the equivalent of "adding a MonoBehaviour to a GameObject" in Unity?

_Short answer:_

The equivalent of `MonoBehaviour` is cgeref:TCastleBehavior[] class documented at link:behaviors[]. You can attach it to cgeref:TCastleTransform[] to control it.

_Full answer:_

There are multiple ways how you can control CGE stuff from code:

. *Define a class descending from cgeref:TCastleBehavior[] (see link:behaviors[]), and add an instance of it to cgeref:TCastleTransform[]*. Like
+
[source,pascal]
----
  type
    TMyBehaviorClass = class(TCastleBehavior)
    public
      procedure Update(const SecondsPassed: Single; var RemoveMe: TRemoveType); override;
    end;
----
+
Then add such behavior instance from code:
+
[source,pascal]
----
  var
    MyBehavior: TMyBehaviorClass;
  begin
    MyBehavior := TMyBehaviorClass.Create(SomOwner);
    MyBehavior.Xxx := ...; // configure necessary parameters
    MyTransform.AddBehavior(MyBehavior);
  end;
----
+
See our template _"3D FPS Game"_ (create it by running our editor, choose _"New Project"_ and then choose _"3D FPS Game"_ as a starting point) that shows exactly this approach. It defines a trivial `TEnemy` class that defines the logic of an enemy, and is a cgeref:TCastleBehavior[] descendant. It controls the enemy movement. It also allows to check (e.g. when shooting ray) "did I hit an enemy" by checking `SomeTransform.FindBehavior(TEnemy) <> nil`.
+
While the above examples show attaching a behavior using code, you could also add `TEnemy` in editor. See link:manual_editor.php[editor] and link:custom_components[custom components] docs for information how to register `TEnemy` class in editor. This requires to restart editor within the project with menu option _"Project \-> Restart Editor (With Custom Components)"_. It is an extra step, but it makes sense for complicated behaviors, which can be configured in the editor easier.
+
The engine comes with a few standard behaviors too (like cgeref:TCastleBillboard[], cgeref:TCastleSoundSource[]) and these are comfortable to add and configure from the editor.

. You can *control things from the view (see link:views[])*. The view like `TViewPlay` (see above mentioned template _"3D FPS Game"_) has its own methods to `Update` and handle input. The view can keep references to everything you have in your world, and it can control them.
+
For example you can process all the creatures in the view method like `TViewPlay.Update`. Our manual about link:https://castle-engine.io/viewport_and_scenes_from_code[controlling viewport using code] shows example of it, to move multiple cars.

. You can also *assign events, like `OnClick`*. Most UI controls expose obvious events, like `TCastleButton.OnClick`. You are free to handle these events at one central place (like an LCL `TForm` descendant (only if you use cgeref:TCastleControl[]), or CGE cgeref:TCastleView[] descendant) or decentralized (e.g. create a different instance of your own class to handle events of each different creature, different item).
+
The approach to use events is similar to using UI in Lazarus LCL or Delphi VCL.
+
This approach is best when you want to handle in one class (the _view_) all events related to some UI, for example clicks on all buttons visible in game options.

. Another way to control things in CGE is to *create class descendants from existing classes*. In CGE you can create descendants from almost all classes (including important cgeref:TCastleTransform[] and cgeref:TCastleUserInterface[]), and override virtual methods there. E.g. you can override `TCastleTransform.Update` to perform something every frame.
+
So you could *define a class like `TMyCreature`* that descends from cgeref:TCastleTransform[] or cgeref:TCastleScene[]. This class would control it's own transformation (e.g. it would change it's own `Translation` to move the creature) and it would possibly load some children (more cgeref:TCastleTransform[] and cgeref:TCastleScene[] instances) to show and animate the creature.
+
This is a classic OOP approach. This is like _Unreal Engine_ that allows you to define your own actor classes that override the base class.
+
You can even link:custom_components[register your custom classes to be available in the editor, to add/configure them visually].


== What is the equivalent of Unity `Assets` subdirectory?

You should place your game data in the `data` subdirectory of the project. See link:data[manual about the "data" directory]. It will be automatically packaged and available in your games.

Everything inside your `data` subdirectory is loadable at runtime. In this sense, it is actually similar to `Assets/Resources/` subdirectory of Unity, if you care about details.

Things that are not your game data (like your source code) should _not_ be placed in the `data` subdirectory. The source code should live outside of data. Only the compiler must be able to find it (you can specify your sources locations using standard Lazarus _Project Options_ and/or (for building cross-platform projects) using https://castle-engine.io/project_manifest[`<compiler_options>` in CastleEngineManifest.xml]). By convention, most CGE examples place Pascal source code in the `code` subdirectory (or in top-level project directory), but this is really only a convention.

The layout of a larger CGE project may be like this:

----
my_project/                    <- the project root
  CastleEngineManifest.xml     <- this manifest file is used by both CGE build tool and CGE editor
  data/                        <- game data lives here; up to you how to organize this
    CastleSettings.xml         <- defines UI scaling, default font
    example_image.png
    example_model.gltf
    gameviewmainmenu.castle-user-interface
    ...
  code/                        <- Pascal game code lives here; up to you how to organize this
    gameinitialize.pas
    gameviewmainmenu.pas      <- Pascal unit corresponding (by convention) to gameviewmainmenu.castle-user-interface
    ...
  ...                          <- any other subdirectories and files? Up to you. Consider docs/ and README.md.
----

== What model formats are supported?

See https://castle-engine.io/creating_data_model_formats.php[supported model formats]. In short: glTF is the best :) This documentation page also links to instructions for various authoring tools "how to export your data".

Test your models with https://castle-engine.io/castle-model-viewer[Castle Model Viewer] to see what is supported. If you double-click on a model from link:editor[editor], it will automatically launch _Castle Model Viewer_.

== Do you support FBX model format?

No, and we will probably never do (unless indirectly, through some universal conversion library or through automatic conversion using https://github.com/godotengine/FBX2glTF[FBX2glTF]). FBX is a proprietary model format by Autodesk. Please don't use FBX, it's proprietary (the Autodesk specification of FBX is "secret" deliberately, and Autodesk only sanctions using FBX through it's paid SDK), and also not that good. Use link:gltf[glTF] which is excellent.

If you have existing models in FBX format you can https://github.com/godotengine/FBX2glTF[convert them to glTF (use Godot Engine fork of FBX2glTF)]. If you have the source versions of your models, possibly you can just reexport them from https://castle-engine.io/creating_data_export.php[your authoring software] to glTF. You can also use https://www.blender.org/[Blender] or a number of https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Generator-Registry/blob/master/dist/REGISTRY.md[other tools] to convert between model formats.

More information: https://castle-engine.io/creating_data_model_formats.php#section_fbx[FBX model format].

== Should I use TCastleWindow or TCastleControl?

A short summary of the answer: Use cgeref:TCastleWindow[]. If all you want is a cross-platform game, where everything is rendered using Castle Game Engine. If you come here and want to "just make a game using CGE", use cgeref:TCastleWindow[].

Details: The difference is outlined on https://castle-engine.io/manual_lazarus_control.php :

* cgeref:TCastleControl[] means that engine rendering is inside Lazarus form. That is, cgeref:TCastleControl[] is a regular Lazarus control that can be placed on a larger form. You can use Lazarus designer to place LCL controls, and you can use CGE editor to design CGE controls (within cgeref:TCastleControl[]).
* cgeref:TCastleWindow[] means that engine rendering is a separate window, and we're not using LCL. You can use CGE editor to design controls. So you lose access to LCL controls, but in exchange you get perfect cross-platform code (Android, iOS, Switch work only with cgeref:TCastleWindow[]).

In both cases, you can use Lazarus as an IDE -- to write code, debug etc. In both cases, you can use CGE editor to design CGE controls (that go inside cgeref:TCastleControl[] or cgeref:TCastleWindow[]).

== Where is `Time.timeScale`?

An equivalent is to set `MyViewport.Items.TimeScale`.

It is specific to the given world, which is an instance of `TCastleAbstractRootTransform` available in `MyViewport.Items`. Simple games will just have one viewport, a cgeref:TCastleViewport[] instance. Multiple instances of cgeref:TCastleViewport[] are possible, and then can share the same world, or show a different world (just assign `Items` between).

There in an additional time scaling possible by cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.TimePlayingSpeed[TCastleScene.TimePlayingSpeed]. This is local in given cgeref:TCastleScene[] instance.

== Where is `Time.deltaTime`?

In `Container.Fps.SecondsPassed`. See the link:view_events[view events] for the most trivial usage example.

In you override the cgeref:TCastleUserInterface.Update[] (including cgeref:TCastleView.Update[]) or `TCastleTransform.Update` method, then you also have an explicit parameter `SecondsPassed` that contains this value. In `TCastleTransform.Update` the time is already scaled (if you used `MyViewport.Items.TimeScale` mentioned above).

== Making components inactive

Both cgeref:TCastleTransform[] and cgeref:TCastleUserInterface[] have a Boolean `Exists` property: cgeref:TCastleTransform.Exists[], cgeref:TCastleUserInterface.Exists[]. By default this is `true`. Simply set it to `false` to make everything behave as if this component was _not_ part of the hierarchy. Non-existing components are not visible, do not collide, do not handle any input, do not cause any events etc. So Unity `GameObject.SetActive(xxx)` translates to CGE `MyTransform.Exists := xxx`.

You can also control the cgeref:TCastleTransform.Collides[], cgeref:TCastleTransform.Pickable[] and cgeref:TCastleTransform.Visible[] properties of cgeref:TCastleTransform[]. These are useful to make something e.g. visible but non-collidable, or collidable but invisible. Note that when `Exists` is `false`, it "overrides" them, and non-existing object never collides and is never visible.

== User interface scaling

We have UI scaling, to adjust to any screen size smartly, and it works similar to Unity canvas scaling. It allows to design assuming a specific window size, and as long as you set sensible anchors, the design will look reasonable at various screen resolutions (even with different aspect ratio). It merely scales the coordinates -- the actual rendering is done for the final resolution, so it looks "sharp" always.

The scaling is configured using https://castle-engine.io/manual_castle_settings.php[CastleSettings.xml] file. The default CGE editor "New Project" templates set UI scaling to adjust with a reference window size of 1600x900.

== Unity Services

Mobile services like ads, analytics, in-app purchases and more are available as link:android_services[Android services] or link:ios_services[iOS services]. You declare them in https://castle-engine.io/project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml] and then build the project using our https://castle-engine.io/build_tool[build tool]. These allow to integrate your code with various 3rd-party services (from Google, Apple and others) or use mobile APIs that require special permissions (like vibrations).

The _"service"_ means _"a part of the project, in binary or source code, added during the build stage"_.

* Android services may contain Java code, precompiled libraries for Android, Gradle configuration and more.
* iOS services may contain Objective-C code, precompiled libraries for iOS, https://cocoapods.org/[CocoaPods] configuration and more.
* On other platforms, so far we didn't need a similar concept. E.g. integration of CGE with 3rd-party services on desktops is always possible by normal Pascal units that expose e.g. link:fmod[FMOD] or link:steam[Steam API]. That said, we plan to add "services" for all platforms at some point -- to distribute anything that contains platform-specific files (like shared libraries) even easier.

== Shaders

You can of course replace or enhance the shaders used by our engine.

We have https://castle-engine.io/compositing_shaders.php[compositing shaders] which is like Unity3d "surface shaders" but on steroids :)  I'm quite proud of this, it really allows to easily write a piece of shader code and add it to some shapes, and (compared to Unity3d "surface shaders") it has some cool new features, like the ability to combine many effects (so you can write one shader effect, maybe add another shader effect), or changing shading of lights or textures or making procedurally generated (on GPU) textures.

See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/viewport_and_scenes/shader_effects[examples/viewport_and_scenes/shader_effects] for simple demo in Pascal that attaches an effect, coded in GLSL, to a scene loaded from glTF. The shader uniform variable can be set at runtime from Pascal of course, and thus you can configure the shader at runtime with zero cost.

See https://github.com/castle-engine/demo-models, subdirectory https://github.com/castle-engine/demo-models/tree/master/compositing_shaders[compositing_shaders] for demos of `Effect` nodes in pure X3D (you can load them all from CGE; it's just that these demos create `Effect` node by X3D code, not by Pascal code).

The https://castle-engine.io/compositing_shaders.php[compositing shaders documentation], in particular https://castle-engine.io/compositing_shaders_doc/html/[this document], describe how these shader effects work.

== Viewports

In Unity, your typical world is a hierarchy of 3D ``GameObject``s.

* Somewhere in this world, you have a `Camera` component, that determines the camera parameters (like projection) and viewport sizes. The transformation of the associated `GameObject` determines the camera position and rotation.
* You can have multiple `Camera` components on different GameObjects to have multiple viewports.
* Somewhere in this world, you have a canvas that acts as a place for 2D controls like buttons and images.

In CGE, it is a bit different. Viewport (cgeref:TCastleViewport[]) is a 2D control, and it can render 3D world inside. This means:

* You design a hierarchy of cgeref:TCastleUserInterface[] components. They all share the same properties to control position and size, using anchors, using cgeref:TCastleUserInterface.FullSize[] (fill the parent) etc.

* There are numerous cgeref:TCastleUserInterface[] descendants, like buttons, images, and *viewports*. So cgeref:TCastleViewport[] is just a descendant of cgeref:TCastleUserInterface[], arranged just like any other UI control.
* Within a viewport (cgeref:TCastleViewport[]) instance, you place your 3D or 2D world (in `Viewport.Items`). `TCastleViewport.Items` is a hierarchy of cgeref:TCastleTransform[]. These are 3D or 2D objects, rendered from the point of chosen camera.

* A viewport always renders using a chosen camera in cgeref:TCastleViewport.Camera[]. This camera determines projection settings and position, rotation of the viewer. This camera determines which part of the world (your cgeref:TCastleTransform[] instances) is visible. There can be multiple cgeref:TCastleCamera[] instances in the world, but at a given time, the viewport renders using the one chosen camera. You can of course change which camera is "chosen" by just changing cgeref:TCastleViewport.Camera[] value at any time.

* To have multiple viewports in _Castle Game Engine_ you, intuitively, need to have multiple instances of cgeref:TCastleViewport[]. They each can occupy a different part of the screen. They can show a different 3D world or the same 3D world. See link:multiple_viewports_to_display_one_world[Multiple viewports to display one world].

The above describes the typical design as seen in editor templates. To see it in action, create a _"New Project"_ in the editor, using the template like _"3D FPS Game"_, and open the design `data/gameviewplay.castle-user-interface` in the editor.

In short, in Unity "viewport" and "camera" and "UI" are just things inside your 3D world. In CGE, "viewport" (and the corresponding "camera") contains your 3D world, and "viewport" is part of your UI.

In effect,

* In CGE the "viewport" can be positioned/sized just like any other 2D control. See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/viewport_and_scenes/multiple_viewports[examples/viewport_and_scenes/multiple_viewports] for an example that shows 4 viewports.
* The Z-order (what is in front/behind) of the viewport in CGE is straightforward, it works just like all other 2D controls. You can easily place other 2D controls in front or behind a viewport (the latter is useful if the viewport has cgeref:TCastleViewport.Transparent[Transparent] background).
* In CGE each "viewport" may show a completely different, unrelated, 3D world. The viewports can also share the world (show the same world from different cameras), simply set them the same `Viewport.Items` value.

== Prefabs

_Prefabs_ are a way to store _GameObject_ hierarchy, with Unity components attached, in a file.

See link:reuse_design[reusable designs]. This is the equivalent of Unity _prefabs_ in _Castle Game Engine_.

The usual equivalent in CGE is to create a `xxx.castle-transform` file where you create a design with a root being cgeref:TCastleTransform[] or cgeref:TCastleScene[]. This allows you to compose a transformation hierarchy of cgeref:TCastleTransform[] / cgeref:TCastleScene[] instances. You can then load this `xxx.castle-transform` multiple times, as a single thing. See the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/advanced_editor[examples/advanced_editor], the file `data/soldier_with_cape.castle-transform` there is a simplest example of this approach.

The equivalent of prefabs for Unity UI elements is a UI design file, `xxx.castle-user-interface`, already mentioned above.

== Playing sounds

The equivalent of Unity https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AudioSource.html[AudioSource] is our cgeref:TCastleSoundSource[]. It is a behavior, you attach it to a parent cgeref:TCastleTransform[] and it can play spatialized sound. Note that for non-spatial sounds, you can also just call cgeref:TSoundEngine.Play[], this is simpler and there's no need for a `TCastleSoundSource` instances.

The equivalent of Unity https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AudioClip.html[AudioClip] is our cgeref:TCastleSound[].

See link:sound[manual chapter about sound] for information how to use sound in CGE.

== What is the difference between `Owner` and `Parent` in CGE?

* `Owner` comes from from the standard `TComponent`. See link:modern_pascal#_manual_and_automatic_freeing[Manual and automatic freeing (Pascal introduction)]. It manages memory (owner will free the owned instance, when the owner is freed before the owned).
* `Parent` is a visual parent. CGE UI has cgeref:TCastleUserInterface.Parent[]. CGE transformations have cgeref:TCastleTransform.Parent[].

So `Parent` and `Owner` are separate concepts, even declared in different classes.

Sometimes both `Parent` and `Owner` may be set to the same instance, if it is suitable in the particular situation, but in general these 2 things just perform 2 separate functions. For example, in CGE editor, owner of everything in the design is always one central `DesignOwner` component. When you load the design yourself, you provide the `Owner` instance explicitly (as a parameter to `UserInterfaceLoad`, `TransformLoad`, `ComponentLoad`) and then you specify parent yourself but adding the design to the hierarchy (e.g. `MyParentUi.InsertFront(MyLoadedUi)`).

== Where is UnityWebRequest (WWW)?

Use cgeref:TCastleDownload[]. Similarly to `UnityWebRequest`, this class can send HTTP requests (GET, POST and others) and can download data asynchronously. It has been designed as an easy but also powerful way to get any resource (over the network or not).

In addition to supporting HTTP(S), our cgeref:TCastleDownload[] can also get data from other resources (`file://`, game data, registered ZIP files, custom protocols...) so you can easily configure where you get your data from. See link:url[URLs, loading (downloading) and saving resources] for more information.

See also link:multi_player[Multi-player options] for a description of cgeref:TCastleDownload[] features to communicate with HTTP REST servers.

Our examples in https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/network[examples/network] demonstrate it.

== Physics forces API

This is how various physics forces methods (see link:physics[]) map from Unity to CGE:

- https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddForceAtPosition.html -> cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.AddForceAtPosition[] (both take 2 params "Force, Position" in world coordinate space)

- https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddRelativeForce.html -> cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.AddForce[] (both take 1 param "Force"). Pass `ForceInLocalCoordinates` = `true`.

- https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddForce.html -> cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.AddForce[] (both take 1 param "Force"). Pass `ForceInLocalCoordinates` = `false`.

- https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddTorque.html -> cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.AddTorque[] (both take 1 param, "Torque", in world coordinate space)

The above mapping applies to default Unity usage with `ForceMode.Force`.

For impulses (using Unity API with `ForceMode.Impulse`) we have a separate method cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.ApplyImpulse[].
