# Castle Image Viewer
include::common.adoc[]
:description: Image viewer using Castle Game Engine. Many image formats supported - common formats (PNG, JPEG, BMP, PPM...) and some exotic formats useful for gamedev and 3D visualization (KTX, DDS, RGBE). Includes some specialized editing functions - to scale, to perform alpha bleeding (fix alpha on textures with transparency).

== Introduction

Image viewer with support for many image formats, including common formats (PNG, JPG...) and some exotic formats useful in gamedev and 3D visualization (KTX, DDS, RGBE).

NOTE: If you already have link:/[Castle Game Engine], then just run `castle-image-viewer` executable from the engine `bin` subdirectory. There's no need to download it separately.

== Features

- *Load and save many image formats*, including some "exotic" ones: *KTX, DDS, RGBE*. Detailed list below.
- Easily *scale and move* the image (use keys, mouse dragging, mouse wheel).
- *Browse* all the images within a single directory (use keys _Page Up_, _Page Down_).
- Test how image looks *tiled (repeatable)* (to test is it good for a repeatable texture).
- See how *alpha channel* of the image looks (menu items _"View -> Use Image Alpha Channel"_, _"View -> Background Color"_),
- Edit image to *mirror, rotate, resize, make grayscale* and so on.
- Perform *link:manual_alpha_bleeding.php[alpha bleeding]* (fixes the artifacts when scaling textures with transparent parts).
- You can browse all *subimages (like mipmaps, or layers of 3D textures)* within a composite image formats (like KTX, DDS).

== Image formats supported

PNG::
Excellent open format for images, offering good lossless image compression, full alpha channel (i.e. partial transparency using blending), supported by almost every image software in the world.
+
Loaded using http://www.libpng.org/[LibPNG] for maximum efficiency. Has a fallback(in case LibPNG is missing) on Pascal loader from https://github.com/galfar/imaginglib[Vampyre Imaging Library].

JPEG, GIF, TGA, XPM, PSD, PCX, PNM, PBM, PGM, PPM, BPM::
Common image formats, supported by many tools.
+
Loaded using https://github.com/galfar/imaginglib[Vampyre Imaging Library], eventually native support or https://wiki.freepascal.org/fcl-image[fcl-image].
+
NOTE: We do not recommend to rely on _Castle Game Engine_ reading PSD files directly. While we support some common PSD features, ultimately the only software that can read PSD files perfectly is _Adobe PhotoShop_. So it's better to use PSD as a development format, and export to PNG for final usage.
+
NOTE: For most of the above formats, PNG is a better alternative. E.g. PNG will result in smaller file size (without losing any features) compared to PNM, PBM, PGM, PPM, XPM. PNG will be loaded much much faster than XPM (text-only format that is very slow to load). PNG is more widely supported and has proper specification, unlike PCX. And while using JPG is common (due to its lossy but often high-quality compression), this compression is somewhat wasted when loading images to GPU.

KTX::
https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/tools/KTX/file_format_spec/[Khronos Texture format].
+
Excellent image format to utilize various graphic features, like GPU compression (images stay compressed in GPU memory), explicit mipmaps, cube maps, volume (3D) textures. Bright future: there's support for excellent KTX 2 coming.
+
With _Castle Image Viewer_ you can view all subimages within one DDS file, see menu items _"Images -> Next/Previous Subimage in composite (DDS, KTX)"_.

DDS::
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectDraw_Surface[Direct Draw Surface]. Similar to KTX, but older. Saving to DDS is also supported.

RGBE::
Simple HDR (high dynamic range) format.
+
The format name is an acronym for _Red + Green + Blue + Exponent_, it was developed by by _Greg Ward_, described in "_Graphic Gems II_", used e.g. in http://floyd.lbl.gov/radiance/[Radiance].
+
It makes sense to use this if you need data in floating-point format, e.g. to load it to cgeref:TRGBFloatImage[].

////
*TIFF*, *JP2*:

Supported using <a href="https://castle-engine.io/wp/2021/12/18/integration-with-vampyre-imaging-library-new-example-image_display-to-test-image-loading-speed-and-format-support/">Vampyre Imaging Library</a>.

Note: JP2 support is not available on all platforms.
Quoting _Vampyre_ comments: _JPEG2000 only for 32bit Windows/Linux/OSX and for 64bit Unix with FPC_.
See the <a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/src/vampyre_imaginglib/src/Extensions/ImagingJpeg2000.pas#L19">exact rule in source code</a> that sets allowed platforms.

Same for TIFF. As it was causing trouble on mobile (not possible to use on Arm, would require distributing extra libs for Aarch64) we decided to disable it by default, for now. You can use `ImagingTiff` unit (add it to uses clause anywhere in your source code) and define `CASTLE_ENABLE_PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_IMAGE_FORMATS` to use it.
////

== Miscellaneous keybindings

Most of the key bindings are available as menu items. Below are the only exceptions:

`Arrows`::
Move image.

`Arrows + Ctrl`::
Move image 10 x faster.

`-` `+`::
Scale image.

`x` `X`::
Scale image only horizontally.

`y` `Y`::
Scale image only vertically.

== Command-line options

Image viewer maintains an image list that you can browse using _Page Up_ / _Page Down_.
Using the command-line options you can specify the list of images to display.

Every command-line parameter must be one of:

A directory name::
Display all images found in the given directory.
+
E.g. `castle-view-image ~/my_images/` displays all images in `~/my_images/` directory.

A filename::
Display this image and browse other images in the same directory.

`@<filename>`::
Read image filenames from file `<filename>`, each line is one filename.
+
`<filename>` equals `-` means _"standard input"_, as usual, so you can pipe output of e.g. `find` program to `castle-view-image` like this:
+
```bash
find . -name '*.jpg' -print | castle-view-image.exe @-
```

Running `castle-view-image` with no parameters opens all images in the current directory.
If none found, the default welcome image will be displayed.

All link:opengl_options[standard options understood by our GUI programs]
and all link:common_options[standard options understood by all our programs]
are handled as well.

== Image Saving Notes

Resulting image format is determined by filename extension, unknown
extension will result in error.

Image loaded and displayed by castle-view-image is internally always stored
in format comfortable for OpenGL. This includes many formats, but not RGBE.
It means that if you will load RGBE image to castle-view-image and then
you will save it (even to the RGBE format again)
then you loose RGBE precision (and clamp color values above 1.0).

Also, S3TC compressed images (from KTX, DDS files) will be always decompressed,
and saving them back will always make uncompressed files.
