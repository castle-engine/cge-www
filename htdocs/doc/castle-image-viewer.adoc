# Castle Image Viewer
include::common.adoc[]
:description: Image viewer using Castle Game Engine. Many image formats supported - common formats (PNG, JPEG, BMP, PPM...) and some exotic formats useful for gamedev and 3D visualization (KTX, DDS, RGBE). Includes some specialized editing functions - to scale, to perform alpha bleeding (fix alpha on textures with transparency).

== Features

- *Load and save many image formats*, including some "exotic" ones: *link:ktx[KTX], DDS, RGBE*. Detailed list below.
- Easily *scale and move* the image (use keys, mouse dragging, mouse wheel).
- *Browse* all the images within a single directory (use keys _Page Up_, _Page Down_).
- Test how image looks *tiled (repeatable)* (to test is it good for a repeatable texture).
- See how *alpha channel* of the image looks (menu items _"View -> Use Image Alpha Channel"_, _"View -> Background Color"_),
- Edit image to *mirror, rotate, resize, make grayscale* and so on.
- Perform *link:manual_alpha_bleeding.php[alpha bleeding]* (fixes the artifacts when scaling textures with transparent parts).
- You can browse all *subimages (like mipmaps, or layers of 3D textures)* within a composite image formats (like KTX, DDS).

== Image formats supported

PNG::
Excellent open format for images, offering good lossless image compression, full alpha channel (i.e. partial transparency using blending), high-precision (16-bit) data if necessary, supported by almost every image software in the world.
+
Loaded using http://www.libpng.org/[LibPNG] for maximum efficiency. The code has a fallback (in case LibPNG is missing) on Pascal loader from https://github.com/galfar/imaginglib[Vampyre Imaging Library].

JPEG, GIF, TGA, XPM, PSD, PCX, PNM, PBM, PGM, PPM, BPM::
Common image formats, supported by many tools.
+
These formats are loaded using https://github.com/galfar/imaginglib[Vampyre Imaging Library], eventually native support or https://wiki.freepascal.org/fcl-image[fcl-image].
+
[NOTE]
====
For most of the above image formats, PNG is a better alternative, and we recommend it over the "common image formats" listed above. Some reasons:

- PNM, PBM, PGM, PPM, XPM offer no compression, while PNG offers lossless compression.
///Thus they are larger on disk, without any real benefit, at least in common cases (maybe in your use-case, there's a benefit if you interchange with some software).

- XPM is a text-only format that is very slow to load.

- PCX does not have a precise specification and is not widely supported (anymore).

- JPG has lossy but often high-quality compression, thus it makes sense for e.g. photos. But for games, the disk size is often not critical (large disk size of game data is often acceptable) and when loading image to GPU, the JPG compression doesn't matter anyway.

- PDS is supported only partially. Ultimately the only software that can read PSD files perfectly is _Adobe PhotoShop_. So it's better to use PSD as a development format, and export to PNG for final usage.
====

KTX::
_Khronos Texture Format_. Excellent image format to utilize various graphic features, like GPU compression (images stay compressed in GPU memory), explicit mipmaps, cube maps, volume (3D) textures, various data precision (8-bit int, 16-bit int, 32-bit float), super-fast loading and saving in many cases.
//Already mentioned above:Saving to KTX is also supported.
+
See link:ktx[details about KTX features and our support].
+
With _Castle Image Viewer_ you can view all subimages within one DDS file, see menu items _"Images -> Next/Previous Subimage in composite (DDS, KTX)"_.

DDS::
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectDraw_Surface[Direct Draw Surface]. Similar to KTX, but older. Saving to DDS is also supported. If you can, we recommend to use link:ktx[KTX] instead of DDS for new applications, as KTX offers even more features that map to GPU usage in a straightforward way.
+
See link:dds[details about DDS features and our support].

RGBE::
Simple HDR (high dynamic range) format.
+
The format name is an acronym for _Red + Green + Blue + Exponent_, it was developed by by _Greg Ward_, described in "_Graphic Gems II_", used e.g. in http://floyd.lbl.gov/radiance/[Radiance].
+
It makes sense to use this if you need data in floating-point format, e.g. to load it to cgeref:TRGBFloatImage[].

////
*TIFF*, *JP2*:

Supported using <a href="https://castle-engine.io/wp/2021/12/18/integration-with-vampyre-imaging-library-new-example-image_display-to-test-image-loading-speed-and-format-support/">Vampyre Imaging Library</a>.

Note: JP2 support is not available on all platforms.
Quoting _Vampyre_ comments: _JPEG2000 only for 32bit Windows/Linux/OSX and for 64bit Unix with FPC_.
See the <a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/src/vampyre_imaginglib/src/Extensions/ImagingJpeg2000.pas#L19">exact rule in source code</a> that sets allowed platforms.

Same for TIFF. As it was causing trouble on mobile (not possible to use on Arm, would require distributing extra libs for Aarch64) we decided to disable it by default, for now. You can use `ImagingTiff` unit (add it to uses clause anywhere in your source code) and define `CASTLE_ENABLE_PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_IMAGE_FORMATS` to use it.
////

== Miscellaneous keybindings

Most of the key bindings are available as menu items. Below are the only exceptions:

`Arrows`::
Move image.

`Arrows + Ctrl`::
Move image 10 x faster.

`-` `+`::
Scale image.

`x` `X`::
Scale image only horizontally.

`y` `Y`::
Scale image only vertically.

== Command-line options

Image viewer maintains an image list that you can browse using _Page Up_ / _Page Down_.
Using the command-line options you can specify the list of images to display.

Every command-line parameter must be one of:

A directory name::
Display all images found in the given directory.
+
E.g. `castle-image-viewer ~/my_images/` displays all images in `~/my_images/` directory.

A filename::
Display this image and browse other images in the same directory.

`@<filename>`::
Read image filenames from file `<filename>`, each line is one filename.
+
`<filename>` equals `-` means _"standard input"_, as usual, so you can pipe output of e.g. `find` program to `castle-image-viewer` like this:
+
```shell
find . -name '*.jpg' -print | castle-image-viewer.exe @-
```

Running `castle-image-viewer` with no parameters opens all images in the current directory.
If none found, the default welcome image will be displayed.

All link:opengl_options.php[standard options understood by our GUI programs]
and all link:common_options.php[standard options understood by all our programs]
are handled as well.

== Image Saving Notes

Resulting image format is determined by the filename extension. Unknown extension will result in an error.

////
This is no longer true, you can save RGBE to e.g. TRGBFloatImage in KTX.

Image loaded and displayed by castle-image-viewer is internally always stored
in format comfortable for OpenGL. This includes many formats, but not RGBE.
It means that if you will load RGBE image to castle-image-viewer and then
you will save it (even to the RGBE format again)
then you loose RGBE precision (and clamp color values above 1.0).
////

GPU-compressed images (like with S3TC compression) will be decompressed at load by this application, and saving them back will make images without GPU compression.

NOTE: The above is just a quirk of this application _Castle Image Viewer_, as we need to decompress GPU-compressed data to enable some editing operations on CPU. In general, using [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/) API you can load and save GPU-compressed images, keeping them compressed, if you wish.
