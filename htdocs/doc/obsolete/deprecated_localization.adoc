*NOTE: This localization approach is deprecated, as it has less features than the GetText approach*.

You can use our own localization approach from the
<a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/src/deprecated_units/castlelocalization.pas">CastleLocalization</a>
<?php /* echo cgeRef('CastleLocalization'); */ ?>
 unit. It can read from a number of translation formats (XML, JSON, CSV, GetText MO). It can translate user-interface controls, like <?php echo cgeRef('TCastleLabel'); ?>. The demo is inside <a href="https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/localization/custom">examples/localization/custom/</a>.

For advanced users, the system allows to aid in localizing your custom classes too (see
<?php /* echo cgeRef('OnUpdateLocalization'); */ ?>
`OnUpdateLocalization`)
and to add your own translation formats (see
<?php /* echo cgeRef('FileLoader'); */ ?>
`FileLoader`).

As with GetText approach, you can use a cross-platform <?php echo cgeRef('CastleSystemLanguage'); ?> unit that tells you the preferred user language. You can also translate strings "explicitly" using the
 `Localization.Items['my_id']`
 in CastleLocalization.

_Thousand thanks go to Benedikt Magnus for developing this approach!_

This localization approach is deprecated.
<?php echo cgeRef('CastleLocalizationGetText'); ?> offers more features:


- Translating `resourcestrings` (so the constant strings in code are "magically" translated),
- <?php echo cgeRef('GenerateGetTextPo'); ?> (generating translation template),
- <?php echo cgeRef('TranslateAllDesigns'); ?> (automatic translation of all deserialized components),
- uses <?php echo cgeRef('TCastleComponent.TranslateProperties'); ?> (mutiple translatable properties on a component are possible).
