== Export to X3D

link:https://www.blender.org/[Blender] includes exporter for X3D out-of-the-box.

Unfortunately, it doesn't support animations.
And since Blender 2.8 it is even more limited,
it doesn't support any textures either.

There are also bugs.
Be sure to use the latest Blender versions (2.82 or later), and consider appplying these
fixes yourself:
