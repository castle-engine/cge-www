# Castle Model Converter
:description: Command-line converter from all 3D and 2D model formats supported by Castle Game Engine (glTF, X3D, VRML, MD3, OBJ, STL, Collada, Spine JSON, sprite sheets..) to X3D. Free and open-source software. For Linux, Windows, macOS, Raspberry Pi and more.

== Introduction

`castle-model-converter` is a command-line converter from various 3D and 2D model formats supported by _Castle Game Engine_ to X3D.

]

As input, supports link:creating_data_model_formats.php[all model formats supported by Castle Game Engine], including:

- link:gltf[glTF],
- link:vrml_x3d.php[X3D],
- link:vrml_x3d.php[VRML],
- link:spine[Spine JSON],
- link:sprite_sheets[sprite sheets (in Castle Game Engine, Cocos2D and Starling XML formats)],
- link:md3[MD3],
- Wavefront OBJ,
- 3DS,
- STL,
- Collada.

As output, right now we support only X3D or VRML. We plan to add glTF output support also soon.

It can also validate the models, without outputting anything.

NOTE: Our _"validation"_ isn't 100% complete, that is: passing the validation doesn't guarantee that your model satisfies every detail of the specification of given format. We check for a lot of model issues (including, but not limited to, issues that would make it impossible to render this model using our engine). But it's not a complete validation of the model per every detail of the specification.

== Download

Simply download link:castle-model-viewer[Castle Model Viewer]. The downloaded package contains also `castle-model-converter` binary.

You can also use our link:convert.php[online version of the converter].

Source code is available on GitHub as part of https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-model-viewer[castle-model-viewer repository].

== Features

A dedicated command-line program
`castle-model-converter` is included in the `castle-model-viewer` download.
It provides a few more conversion and validation options,
can be used in batch mode,
can be used on servers without GUI libraries installed.

You can convert between X3D classic and XML encodings (in both directions),
and you can convert from VRML 2 to X3D.
You can also use castle-model-viewer as a "pretty-printer",
just open and save any X3D or VRML file without any version conversion.

== Usage

`castle-model-converter` is a dedicated program to convert model formats
using the command-line.
It provides a few more conversion and validation options,
and can be used in batch mode,
and can be used on servers without GUI libraries installed.

Examples:

```bash
# Convert glTF to X3D
castle-model-converter input.gltf > output.x3dv

# Validate some glTF and X3D files
castle-model-converter --validate input.gltf
castle-model-converter --validate input.x3d

# Convert standard input to X3D
castle-model-converter - < input.x3dv > output.x3dv
castle-model-converter - --stdin-url=fakeurl.gltf < input.gltf > output.x3dv

# Convert VRML 2.0 to X3D in classic encoding.
# You could add --encoding=classic, but it's not needed
# (it is the default anyway).
castle-model-converter input.wrl --force-x3d > output.x3dv

# Convert VRML 2.0 to X3D in XML encoding.
# You could add --force-x3d, but it's not needed
# (it is implied by XML encoding anyway).
castle-model-converter input.wrl --encoding=xml > output.x3d
```

Here are most important `castle-model-converter` command-line features:

- `castle-model-converter` always reads one input model (from the filename or URL given on the command-line).
+
You can use `-` (dash) as the input filename to read from the standard input. It may be useful to also use the `--stdin-url` option in this case, to indicate the file type and base URL to resolve other referenced files (e.g. binary blobs of glTF, which we need to read to convert it to X3D).

- `castle-model-converter` outputs the model on a standard output as VRML/X3D.

- `--validate` option is useful to validate the input model.
+
In effect, we will not output a converted model on the standard output and we will exit with non-zero status if the input is not 100% valid.

- `--encoding=classic|xml` instructs to use given encoding. See `--write-encoding=classic|xml` docs above.

-`--force-x3d` instructs to force X3D conversion. See `--write-force-x3d` docs above.

Run `castle-model-converter --help` to see the full list of options.
