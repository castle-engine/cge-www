## Introduction

link:http://openal.org/[OpenAL] is an open-source cross-platform library to play 3D sound. It is the default sound backend used by _Castle Game Engine_ to play all the sounds.

If you want to learn how to play sounds using _Castle Game Engine_, see the link:sound[manual about sound]. This pages only lists some OpenAL-specific information.

## Installing OpenAL

Windows:: OpenAL libraries (DLL files) are automatically places alongside the compiled application by our link:build_tool[build tool]. You don't need to do anything, just compile and run your application using link:manual_editor.php[Castle Game Engine editor] or link:build_tool[build tool].

Linux:: Install a package like `libopenal1`. There is no need to install the package `libopenal-dev` present on some Linux distributions (it contains C headers and symlinks that we don't need).

FreeBSD:: Install by `pkg_add -r openal`.

macOS:: You have OpenAL already installed, it is provided by Apple.

## Command-line options that control the sound outupt

`--no-sound`:: Don't output any sound (even if OpenAL is available on this system).

`--audio-device DEVICE-NAME`:: Use given `DEVICE-NAME` for sound output.
+
To list the available OpenAL devices use the `--help` command-line option.
The `--audio-device` description will show a list of devices detected.
+
Particular applications may also expose this choice using a nice GUI, e.g. link:castle.php[The Castle] has a simple menu to choose the device.
In link:view3dscene.php[view3dscene] you can choose it using _"File -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Sound Device"_ menu item.
