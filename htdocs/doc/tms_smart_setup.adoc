== TMS Smart Setup

Our engine can be also installed using https://github.com/tmssoftware/smartsetup[TMS Smart Setup] for Delphi.

This installs our packages in Delphi(s), with benefits being:

* more automatic (command-line to get and install),
* support for installing in multiple Delphi versions at the same time (as it automatically adds the suitable `libsuffix`, which our own packages don't do yet -- see below for details why).
* For more details see https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/blog.asp?post=1146[TMS blog post] and https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/issues/678#issuecomment-3000913493[GH issue where we talk about it].

The drawback is that this doesn't install our tools (like https://castle-engine.io/editor[editor] or https://castle-engine.io/build_tool[build tool]). As such, it's not the advised way to install our engine right now for most users (better follow our https://castle-engine.io/delphi_packages[installation instructions for Delphi]).

However, it you just want to bring CGE components to be recognized by the Delphi IDE (and you don't need our tools), this is a great (and automated) solution. A _continuous integration/delivery_, like using https://castle-engine.io/github_actions[GitHub Actions], that tests compilation of our packages (or packages on top of them) is also thus possible.

== Usage Instructions

=== First, be sure to remove packages installed manually

When switching from https://castle-engine.io/delphi_packages[manual Delphi package installation] and using _TMS Smart Setup_ documented here, be sure to first uninstall previous engine packages from the Delphi IDE. We recommend to just remove all the `*castle.bpl` files from your packages (`c:/Users/Public/Documents/Embarcadero/Studio/<Delphi-version>/Bpl/`).

Reason: Using _TMS Smart Setup_ adds _libsuffix_ (to support installation in multiple Delphi versions), but our manual packages do not (as it would require to maintain multiple package versions). In the future we may drop older Delphis support, or auto-generate packages (see the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/pull/680[#680] for details), thus avoiding this inconsistency.

=== Installing using TMS Smart Setup

. Get https://github.com/tmssoftware/smartsetup , with submodules, in branch `git-registry`. Command-line:
+
----
git clone https://github.com/tmssoftware/smartsetup
cd smartsetup
git checkout git-registry
git submodule update --init --recursive # get submodules in externals/
----

. Build and move the `.../bin/Win64/Debug/tms.exe` binary anywhere to `$PATH` on your system.
. Create and enter and directory to host the configuration, like `c:/smartsetup-test`. Enter it from the command-line and execute following commands inside it:
. `tms config` (it will open YAML file in your code editor; in principle you don't need to tweak it, the default config should work out-of-the-box)
. `tms server-enable community`
. `tms install castle.engine`
+
NOTE: Trouble? Try `tms install castle.engine -verbose`.
+
NOTE: If you're on Windows and you get `fatal: cannot create directory at ...: Filename too long` error then try doing `git config --global core.longpaths true`. See link:compiling_from_source.php[Compiling from source] for more info.

== TODO: Finish testing these instructions, add below:

From https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/issues/678#issuecomment-3000913493

That's it, it should clone the castleengine git repo, build all the packages, and register them in the delphi ide.

Once you have it installed, to play, you can:

1. Edit the tmsbuild.yam file that is placed at the root of the folder. You might try uncommenting linux for example (I couldn't make it work here, so I kept it commented).
2. tms build and tms build -full -> This calls the builder, so you can make changes and test them. -full will force building everything even if it didn't change.
3. tms log-view -> If there are errors, this will open a browser window with the logs of what happened.
4. tms build -unregister -> this will unregister from the IDE, but keep the files
5. tms uninstall castle.engine -> THIS WILL DELETE THE FOLDER, WITH ANY CHANGES YOU MADE TOO.

TODO: take a look at https://github.com/tmssoftware/smartsetup-registry/blob/main/castle.engine/tmsbuild.yaml
- castle engine -> Castle Game Engine?
- linux to fmx
