:description: Using Visual Studio Code with intelligent code completion for Pascal and Castle Game Engine API.
:cge-social-share-image: vscode_completion.png

== Introduction

https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] is a powerful, free and open-source, cross-platform text editor for programmers.

Below we describe how to configure it to be a perfect code editor for Pascal, and in particular for your _Castle Game Engine_ projects. We're proud to provide an LSP server that will make VS Code do _intelligent code completion_ that works great with Pascal and automatically completes all _Castle Game Engine_ API.

NOTE: The configuration described here also works with https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium[VSCodium], a version of VS Code built using 100% open-source code (without e.g. Microsoft telemetry).
////
And many other text editors (like Emacs, NeoVim) can also use the LSP server described on this page, see <<Other text editors>>.
////

== Make Castle Game Engine invoke VS Code

Go to _Castle Game Engine_ editor preferences, _"Code Editor"_ tab, and select the _"Visual Studio Code"_.

cgeimg::block[vscode_preferences.png|Configure VS Code in CGE Preferences]

This will make CGE automatically open _VS Code_ when you open Pascal file

- by double-clicking Pascal unit from CGE editor _"Files"_ panel,
- by double-clicking a message in the _"Output"_ window referencing some Pascal file,
- using menu item _"Code -> Open Project in Code Editor"_,
- and in all other cases when CGE wants to open Pascal file.

== Pascal syntax highlighting

There are multiple _VS Code_ extensions that provide Pascal code highlighting.

We recommend https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AnsonYeung.pascal-language-basics[Pascal Language Basics]. It's available in the _VS Code_ marketplace, so you can just search for it and install right inside the VS Code _"Extensions"_ panel.

[NOTE]
====
Searching extensions' marketplace for _"Pascal"_ will yield a number of solid alternatives. They will likely work just as well for your Pascal and CGE editing, go ahead and try them. We just recommend choosing any "simple" extension that adds Pascal highlighting but _doesn't_ do code completion and parsing (because the LSP server will already take care of it).

For _VS Codium_ users, the https://open-vsx.org/extension/theangryepicbanana/language-pascal[Pascal magic] extension may be the easiest to install, as is available in the _VS Codium_ (and _VS Code_ too) extensions' marketplace.
====

== Pascal code completion

We provide an _LSP server_ that implements an _intelligent code completion_ for Pascal and is aware of _Castle Game Engine_ units and default syntax options (e.g. FPC _ObjFpc_ mode).

NOTE: https://github.com/castle-engine/pascal-language-server[Our LSP server] is based on https://github.com/Isopod/pascal-language-server[Philip Zander\'s LSP server] which in turn relies on https://www.lazarus-ide.org/[Lazarus] _CodeTools_ to do the code completion. So inside there is really a lot of work and testing from many people in the Pascal ecosystem to make it powerful.

To use it with VS Code:

1. Install the https://github.com/genericptr/pasls-vscode[Pascal Language Server Extension for Visual Studio Code]. It's easiest to do this by:
+
--
- Downloading https://github.com/genericptr/pasls-vscode/raw/master/pascal-language-server-0.0.1.vsix[this VSIX file].
- Use _"Install from VSIX..."_ menu item in VS Code to install it:
+
cgeimg::block[vscode_install_vsix.png|Install from VSIX]
- Once done, you will see _"Pascal Language Server"_ extension installed. Make sure it is enabled.
--

2. Configure the extension, pointing it to your FPC, Lazarus, and `pasls` (our LSP server).
+
cgeimg::block[vscode_extension_config.png|VS Code Extension configuration]
+
--
- Open the extension settings.
- Set `Env: FPCDIR` to point to the FPC source code. If you use FPC bundled with CGE, this should look like `<cgepath>/tools/contrib/fpc/src/`.
- Set `Env: FPCTARGET` to your OS, like `linux` or `win64`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Use _operating system_ names that match FPC and CGE. You can see valid OS names:

- In CGE editor menu _"Run -> Platform (To Compile And Run) -> ..."_.
- If you execute on the command-line link:build_tool[build tool] as `castle-engine --help`. Look for possible arguments for the `--os` option.

You can also leave it empty, our LSP will autodetect it.
====
+
- Set `Env: FPCTARGETCPU` to your CPU, like `x86_64`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Use _processor_ names that match FPC and CGE. You can see valid CPU names:

- In CGE editor menu _"Run -> Platform (To Compile And Run) -> ..."_.
- If you execute on the command-line link:build_tool[build tool] as `castle-engine --help`. Look for possible arguments for the `--cpu` option.

You can also leave it empty, our LSP will autodetect it.
====
- Set `Env: LAZARUSDIR` to your Lazarus (source) directory. This is optional, fill it if you have https://www.lazarus-ide.org/[Lazarus] installed. It will enable to find LCL units and do the code completion for LCL components too.
- Set `Env: PP` to your FPC executable. If you use FPC bundled with CGE, this should look like `<cgepath>/tools/contrib/fpc/bin/fpc-cge`. Add `.exe` extension on Windows. If you use regular FPC, this is a path to your regular FPC executable (`fpc`, `fpc.exe`, `fpc.sh`).
- Finally, set `Executable` to point to our LSP server, inside CGE `bin` subdirectory. This should look like `<cgepath>/bin/pasls`. Add `.exe` extension on Windows.
--

[start=3]
1. Enjoy!
+
--
- Open any _Castle Game Engine_ project.
- You can open it from _Castle Game Engine_ editor (e.g. by _"Code -> Open Project in Code Editor"_ menu item).
- Or you can open it from VS Code, using _"File -> Open Folder"_.
- Place your cursor somewhere, hit _Ctrl + Space_ and enjoy a proper code completion.
+
cgeimg::block[vscode_completion.png|VS Code Extension configuration]
- Right click on any Pascal item and use _"Go To Definition"_, _"Go To Declaration"_ or just _Ctrl + click_ on it to move around. You can also peek at definition and declaration using _"Peek -> ..."_.
--

NOTE: There are more VS Code extension settings, but most of them are not handled (and not necessary) for our LSP server, they are only handled by the alternative https://github.com/genericptr/pascal-language-server[Ryan Joseph\'s Pascal LSP server].

[NOTE]
====
If you have installed FPC yourself using link:fpcupdeluxe[] on Unix, remember to point `Env: PP` to the `fpc.sh` script (and not to the `fpc` binary) that should always be used to execute FPC managed by `fpcupdeluxe` on Unix.

In general, the `Env: PP` executable may be run by CodeTools, which may assume this FPC version "knows" standard RTL paths. That's why it's important to pass `fpc.sh` (in case of fpcupdeluxe) or `fpc-cge` (in case of FPC bundled with CGE) and not the "bare" `fpc` executable.
====

== Compiling and Running

You can configure _VS Code_ to compile and run CGE applications.

NOTE: The proces below allows for many tweaks for advanced _VS Code_ users but it may look intimidating. Remember this is optional. You can always just compile and run CGE applications from _Castle Game Engine_ editor (use F9, or _"Run -> Compile And Run_" menu item).

=== Tasks

To compile and run CGE projects from _VS Code_, you can define a `tasks.json` file with contents like this: https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/doc/sample_vs_code_tasks.json[sample_vs_code_tasks.json] (use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/master/doc/sample_vs_code_tasks.json[raw version of sample_vs_code_tasks.json for easy copy-paste]).

This file defines 3 CGE tasks and makes the task _"(CGE) Compile And Run"_ the default.

Use this sample as:

* your personal (user-specific, apply to all projects) tasks. Use command _"Tasks: Open User Tasks"_ from the palette (_Ctrl + Shift + P_) to edit this file.

* or inside the `.vscode` folder of your project. Use menu item _"Terminal -> Configure Tasks"_ to edit this file.

=== Environment for tasks

The above sample `tasks.json` assumes that the CGE link:build_tool[build tool] called `castle-engine` can be found on environment variable `PATH`.

Make sure your environment is set correctly to make it work:

- Extend the `PATH` environment variable to contain the `bin` subdirectory of your CGE directory. This is where `castle-engine[.exe]` file should be. If you don't know how to set the environment variable, search the Internet (e.g. https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm[these are quick instructions how to do it on various Windows versions]).
+
_Alternative_: Edit the sample `tasks.json` to provide full path to the build tool exe, like `/home/example/castle_game_engine/bin/castle-engine` instead of just `castle-engine`.

- _(Optional)_ Make sure that compiler (FPC or Delphi) is on `PATH`, so that our build tool can find it.
+
This is not necessary in the common case, when you use FPC bundled with CGE.

- _(Optional)_ Set `CASTLE_ENGINE_PATH` environment variable to point to the root of CGE.
+
This is not necessary if you run the build tool from CGE subdirectory `bin/`, it will auto-detect CGE path then correctly.

- Remember to restart all applications (like VS Code) that need to be aware of new environment variables' values.

=== Keybindings for tasks

You can bind keys to the CGE tasks, to have a similar experience in _VS Code_ as in CGE editor:

- _F9_ should do _"(CGE) Compile And Run"_
- _Ctrl+F9_ should do _"(CGE) Compile"_
- _Shift+F9_ should do _"(CGE) Run"_

To adjust keybindings for tasks, you have to edit your `keybindings.json` file. See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_binding-keyboard-shortcuts-to-tasks[adding shortcuts to tasks] and https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_advanced-customization[editing keybindings] for information how to do this.

Define keys like this in `keybindings.json`:

```json
    {
        "key": "ctrl+f9",
        "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask",
        "args": "(CGE) Compile"
    },
    {
        "key": "shift+f9",
        "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask",
        "args": "(CGE) Run"
    }
```

To define key shortcut for default task _"(CGE) Compile And Run"_ just adjust the _"Tasks: Run Build Task"_ shortcut to F9 in VS Code key shortcuts settings. You can also adjust it by editing `keybindings.json`, as above.

=== Debugging

CGE applications compiled in _debug_ mode contain debug symbols compatible with GDB. Any debugger extension in _VS Code_ based on GDB should work.

This is a sample `launch.json` you can use:

```json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Debug",
            "type": "gdb",
            "request": "launch",
            "target": "./app_name",
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "valuesFormatting": "parseText"
        }
    ]
}
```

For debugging code compiled with FPC, it's very useful to set a breakpoint at `fpc_raiseexception`.

[NOTE]
====
The keybindings are of course your personal choice. Personally I use these:

[role="compact"]
- `F5` - _Debug: Toggle Breakpoint_ (consistent with Delphi / Lazarus)
- `Shift + F5` - _Debug: Start Debugging_
- `Ctrl + F2` - _Debug: Stop_ (consistent with Delphi / Lazarus)

== More Information and Credits

- The LSP server we use is based on https://github.com/Isopod/pascal-language-server[Philip Zander\'s Pascal LSP server].

- Our fork of the LSP server is here: https://github.com/castle-engine/pascal-language-server[LSP server for Pascal and Castle Game Engine].

- https://github.com/genericptr/pasls-vscode[VS Code extension] is developed by _Ryan Joseph_.

- There is an alternative https://github.com/genericptr/pascal-language-server[Ryan Joseph\'s Pascal LSP server]. We have https://github.com/michaliskambi/pascal-language-server-genericptr[forked it too] to add some CGE extensions, though ultimately we decided to not focus on it.

- Both LSP servers are based on initial work of _Arjan Adriaanse_. They both use latest https://www.lazarus-ide.org/[Lazarus] CodeTools to do the actual code completion, so we can enjoy in every editor the same power as Lazarus users.

== Other text editors

The LSP server is fully useful with any text editor that supports LSP, not only _VS Code_.

=== Emacs

You can use it with https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/[Emacs]. See https://github.com/michaliskambi/elisp/tree/master/lsp[Michalis Kamburelis notes about LSP + Pascal + CGE + Emacs].

The short version is:

- Install https://github.com/arjanadriaanse/lsp-pascal[lsp-pascal], `lsp-mode`, `company` Emacs packages,
- Configure it like this in your `~/.emacs`:
+
[source,lisp]
----
(require 'lsp-pascal)

;; choose LSP server binary
(setq lsp-pascal-command "/home/michalis/sources/castle-engine/castle-engine/bin/pasls")

;; pass basic info to LSP server, all LSP Pascal servers above support these:
(setq lsp-pascal-fpcdir "/home/michalis/cge/tools/contrib/fpc/src")
(setq lsp-pascal-lazarusdir "/home/michalis/lazarus")
(setq lsp-pascal-pp "/home/michalis/cge/tools/contrib/fpc/bin/fpc-cge")
(setq lsp-pascal-fpctarget "linux")
(setq lsp-pascal-fpctargetcpu "x86_64")
----

=== NeoVim

The LSP server can be used with http://neovim.io/[NeoVim]. See the `client/nvim` subdirectory of https://github.com/Isopod/pascal-language-server/tree/master/client/nvim[Philip Zander\'s repository].

== Plans, TODOs

* The big plan is to bundle CGE with _VS Code_ at some point in 2023. If you just install (unpack) CGE you should have a ready setup with CGE + VS Code, and VS Code should automatically have Pascal syntax highlighting and code completion.
+
Of course we will still make everything such that you don't have to use this "bundled" VS Code and instead can use your existing VS Code installation, or really any other text editor / IDE, like Lazarus, Emacs, NeoVim etc.

* The LSP server should require less (or even zero) configuration. All the parameters required now by LSP configuration are things that CGE editor knows, after all.

* Can we have "Code Completion" (that happens in Lazarus when you Ctrl + Shift + C) that can automatically insert e.g. method declarations or complete property declarations?

* More automatic CGE tasks. Maybe CGE extension in VS Code? Would also allow to clear problems list before each compilation.
+
In general, if you open a directory with CGE project (`CastleEngineManifest.xml`) then running and debugging it in VS Code should be just a keystroke (like F9) away.

* Better debugging docs.
+
There is https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/[DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol)] with similar goals as LSP, but for debuggers. Maybe someone will wrap Lazarus debugger (GDB with Pascal specific interpretations) in DAP?
