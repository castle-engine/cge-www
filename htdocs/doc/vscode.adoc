:description: Castle Game Engine extension for Visual Studio Code, that provides code completion and highlighting for Pascal and management of Castle Game Engine projects.
:cge-social-share-image: vscode_ext_1.png

== Introduction

https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] is a powerful, free and open-source, cross-platform text editor for programmers.

We provide a https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castle-engine-team.castle-engine[VS Code extension for Castle Game Engine] that makes it easy to use VS Code with CGE:

* Allows to build, run, debug (and more) CGE projects from VS Code.
* Provides Pascal syntax highlighting and code completion.

Moreover, installing CGE will give you our _LSP server_ useful with _VS Code_ or various other text editors (like _Emacs_ or _Vim_) to make _intelligent code completion_ that works great with Pascal and automatically completes all _Castle Game Engine_ API.

TODO:
NOTE: The configuration described here also works with https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium[VSCodium], a version of VS Code built using 100% open-source code (without Microsoft telemetry, and with alternative marketplace).
////

////
And many other text editors (like Emacs, NeoVim) can also use the LSP server described on this page, see <<Other text editors>>.

== Make Castle Game Engine invoke VS Code

Go to _Castle Game Engine_ editor preferences, _"Code Editor"_ tab, and select the _"Visual Studio Code"_.

cgeimg::block[vscode_preferences.png|Configure VS Code in CGE Preferences]

This will make CGE automatically open _VS Code_ when you open Pascal file

- by double-clicking Pascal unit from CGE editor _"Files"_ panel,
- by double-clicking a message in the _"Output"_ window referencing some Pascal file,
- using menu item _"Code -> Open Project in Code Editor"_,
- and in all other cases when CGE wants to open Pascal file.

== Install Castle Game Engine extension in VS Code

Install https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castle-engine-team.castle-engine[Castle Game Engine in VS Code].

You can follow the above link. Or just search for _"Castle Game Engine"_ in the _VS Code_ extensions sidebar.

== Extension Settings and Pascal code completion

After installing https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castle-engine-team.castle-engine[Castle Game Engine in VS Code] extension, go to the extension settings and configure it:

cgeimg::block[vscode_extension_config.png|VS Code Extension configuration]

Details about the extension settings:

Engine Path::
Set this to _Castle Game Engine_ directory. **This is the only thing you really need to configure.** If you installed the engine from our https://castle-engine.io/download[official downloads], then everything else will be auto-detected correctly.
+
Inside this directory we expect to find `bin` subdirectory with our tools, like `pasls` (`pasls.exe` on Windows), link:build_tool[build tool] and link:editor[editor].

PP::
FPC executable. Add `.exe` extension on Windows. If you use regular FPC, this is a path to your regular FPC executable (`fpc`, `fpc.exe`, `fpc.sh`).
+
If you use FPC bundled with CGE, the correct path looks like `<cge-path>/tools/contrib/fpc/bin/fpc-cge`. But actually, you can also leave it blank in this case -- we will autodetect it.
+
If you have installed FPC yourself using link:fpcupdeluxe[] on Unix, remember to point `PP` to the `fpc.sh` script (and not to the `fpc` binary) that should always be used to execute FPC managed by `fpcupdeluxe` on Unix.
+
In general, the `PP` executable may be run by CodeTools, which may assume this FPC version "knows" standard RTL paths. That's why it's important to pass `fpc.sh` (in case of fpcupdeluxe) or `fpc-cge` (in case of FPC bundled with CGE) and not the "bare" `fpc` executable.

FPCDIR::
FPC source code.
+
If you use FPC bundled with CGE, this should look like `<cge-path>/tools/contrib/fpc/src/`. But actually, you can also leave it blank in this case -- we will autodetect it.

LAZARUSDIR::
Lazarus (source) directory. This is optional, fill it if you have https://www.lazarus-ide.org/[Lazarus] installed. It will enable to find LCL units and do the code completion for LCL components too.

FPCTARGET::
Your OS, like `linux` or `win64`.
+
Use _operating system_ names that match FPC and CGE. You can see valid OS names:
+
--
- In CGE editor menu _"Run -> Platform (To Compile And Run) -> ..."_.
- If you execute on the command-line link:build_tool[build tool] as `castle-engine --help`. Look for possible arguments for the `--os` option.
--
+
You can also leave it empty, our LSP will autodetect it.

FPCTARGETCPU::
Your CPU, like `x86_64`.
+
Use _processor_ names that match FPC and CGE. You can see valid CPU names:
+
--
- In CGE editor menu _"Run -> Platform (To Compile And Run) -> ..."_.
- If you execute on the command-line link:build_tool[build tool] as `castle-engine --help`. Look for possible arguments for the `--cpu` option.
--
+
You can also leave it empty, our LSP will autodetect it.

NOTE: https://github.com/castle-engine/pascal-language-server[Our LSP server] is based on https://github.com/Isopod/pascal-language-server[Philip Zander's LSP server] which in turn uses on https://www.lazarus-ide.org/[Lazarus] _CodeTools_ to do the code completion. So inside there is really a lot of work and testing from many people in the Pascal ecosystem to make it powerful.

=== Test Code Completion

- Open any _Castle Game Engine_ project.
- You can open it from _Castle Game Engine_ editor (e.g. by _"Code -> Open Project in Code Editor"_ menu item).
- Or you can open it from VS Code, using _"File -> Open Folder"_.
- Place your cursor somewhere, hit _Ctrl + Space_ and enjoy a proper code completion.
+
cgeimg::block[vscode_completion.png|VS Code Extension configuration]
- Right click on any Pascal item and use _"Go To Definition"_, _"Go To Declaration"_ or just _Ctrl + click_ on it to move around. You can also peek at definition and declaration using _"Peek -> ..."_.

////
== Pascal syntax highlighting

WARNING: TODO: This doc section is super-seeded by the new extension, that automatically gives Pascal code highlighting for you by depending on https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=theangryepicbanana.language-pascal[Pascal magic].

We recommend installing https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=theangryepicbanana.language-pascal[Pascal magic] extension to get Pascal code highlighting.

It's available in the _VS Code_ marketplace, so you can just search for it and install right inside the VS Code _"Extensions"_ panel.

Our https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castle-engine-team.castle-engine[Castle Game Engine in VS Code] depends on it, so you don't need to install it manually anymore.

NOTE: _VS Codium_ users: The https://open-vsx.org/extension/theangryepicbanana/language-pascal[Pascal magic extension is also available in the VS Codium marketplace].

[NOTE]
====
Searching extensions' marketplace for _"Pascal"_ will yield a number of alternatives. They will likely work just as well for your Pascal and CGE editing, go ahead and try them. We just recommend choosing any "simple" extension that adds Pascal highlighting but _doesn't_ do code completion and parsing (because the LSP server will take care of it).

E.g. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AnsonYeung.pascal-language-basics[Pascal Language Basics] is also a solid choice. We recommended it in the past. We switched to _"Pascal magic"_ mainly because it handles better difficult long code in `tools/castle-editor/code/framedesign.pas`.
====

== Compiling and Running

Simply open in _VS Code_ a directory with `CastleEngineManifest.xml`. Our extension will automatically detect it is a CGE project, and will show appropriate buttons on the status bar to compile, run and debug the project.

=== Alternative ways to compile and run (for other text editors or custom needs)

Using our _VS Code_ extension commands is just one way to build and run CGE application. Some alternatives:

- Use link:editor[], menu item _"Run -> Compile And Run_" (F9).

- Use link:lazarus[Lazarus IDE] or link:delphi[Delphi IDE]. You can open CGE project in them.

- Use command-line link:build_tool[build tool]. Like this: `castle-engine compile && castle-engine run`.
+
This approach is also how you can build and run CGE projects from any text editor.
+
You can also define _VS Code_ `tasks.json` file to allow to run the project indicated by the _currently open file_ (so you don't need to open the exact project directory in _VS Code_). https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/doc/sample_vs_code_tasks.json[Place in your `tasks.json` this] (use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/master/doc/sample_vs_code_tasks.json[raw version for easy copy-paste]).
+
This file defines a few CGE tasks and makes the task _"(CGE) Compile And Run"_ the default.
+
Use this sample as:
+
--
* your personal (user-specific, apply to all projects) tasks. Use command _"Tasks: Open User Tasks"_ from the palette (_Ctrl + Shift + P_) to edit this file.

* or place these tasks inside the `.vscode` folder of your project. Use menu item _"Terminal -> Configure Tasks"_ to edit this file.
--
+
The above sample `tasks.json` assumes that the CGE link:build_tool[build tool] called `castle-engine` can be found on environment variable `PATH`.
+
Make sure your environment is set correctly to make it work:
+
--
- Extend the `PATH` environment variable to contain the `bin` subdirectory of your CGE directory. This is where `castle-engine[.exe]` file should be. If you don't know how to set the environment variable, search the Internet (e.g. https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm[these are quick instructions how to do it on various Windows versions]).
+
_Alternative_: Edit the sample `tasks.json` to provide full path to the build tool exe, like `/home/example/castle_game_engine/bin/castle-engine` instead of just `castle-engine`.

- _(Optional)_ Make sure that compiler (FPC or Delphi) is on `PATH`, so that our build tool can find it.
+
This is not necessary in the common case, when you use FPC bundled with CGE.

- _(Optional)_ Set `CASTLE_ENGINE_PATH` environment variable to point to the root of CGE.
+
This is not necessary if you run the build tool from CGE subdirectory `bin/`, it will auto-detect CGE path then correctly.

- Remember to restart all applications (like VS Code) that need to be aware of new environment variables' values.
--

== Keybindings

Our https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castle-engine-team.castle-engine[VS Code extension for Castle Game Engine] defines a few useful keybindings:

- Compile using _Ctrl + F9_ (or _Cmd + F9_ on macOS).

- Run using _Shift + F9_.

- Search API reference using _Ctrl + F1_ (or _Cmd + F1_ on macOS).

- Go to declaration using _Ctrl + F12_ (or _Cmd + F12_ on macOS).

You can change the bindings as you see fit, naturally, using VS Code.
////
See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_binding-keyboard-shortcuts-to-tasks[adding shortcuts to tasks] and https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_advanced-customization[editing keybindings] for information how to do this.
////

== Debugging

Our https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castle-engine-team.castle-engine[VS Code extension for Castle Game Engine] defines a ready debugger called `castleDebug` based on `fpDebug`. Just start debugging in _VS Code_ and choose `castleDebug` as a debugger.

=== Alternative debuggers

Any debugger extension in _VS Code_ able to debug native applications should work.

==== GDB

You can use https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webfreak.debug[Native Debug] with GDB.

This is a sample `launch.json` you can use (edit `app_name` as necessary):

```json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Debug",
            "type": "gdb",
            "request": "launch",
            "target": "./app_name",
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "valuesFormatting": "parseText"
        }
    ]
}
```

For debugging code compiled with FPC, it's very useful to set a breakpoint at `fpc_raiseexception`. Just define a breakpoint at such function name (don't worry that it may seem like it doesn't work -- it will actually work once you run the project).

==== fpDebug (directly)

While CGE extension runs `fpDebug` for you (our `castleDebug` is only a shortcut for preconfigured `fpDebug`), you can also set up and tweak `fpDebug` yourself in the `launch.json`. Here's an example:

```json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Debug",
            "type": "fpDebug",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceRoot}/ui_batching",
            "workingdirectory": "${workspaceRoot}"
        }
    ]
}
```

////
[NOTE]
====
The keybindings are of course your personal choice. Personally I use these:

[role="compact"]
- `F5` - _Debug: Toggle Breakpoint_ (consistent with Delphi / Lazarus)
- `Shift + F5` - _Debug: Start Debugging_
- `Ctrl + F2` - _Debug: Stop_ (consistent with Delphi / Lazarus)

== More Information and Credits

- The LSP server we use is based on https://github.com/Isopod/pascal-language-server[Philip Zander\'s Pascal LSP server].

- Our fork of the LSP server is here: https://github.com/castle-engine/pascal-language-server[LSP server for Pascal and Castle Game Engine].

- There is an alternative https://github.com/genericptr/pascal-language-server[Ryan Joseph\'s Pascal LSP server]. We have https://github.com/michaliskambi/pascal-language-server-genericptr[forked it too] to add some CGE extensions, though ultimately we decided to not focus on it.

- Both LSP servers are based on initial work of _Arjan Adriaanse_. They both use latest https://www.lazarus-ide.org/[Lazarus] CodeTools to do the actual code completion, so we can enjoy in every editor the same power as Lazarus users.

== Other text editors

The LSP server is fully useful with any text editor that supports LSP, not only _VS Code_.

=== Emacs

You can use it with https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/[Emacs]. See https://github.com/michaliskambi/elisp/tree/master/lsp[Michalis Kamburelis notes about LSP + Pascal + CGE + Emacs].

The short version is:

- Install https://github.com/arjanadriaanse/lsp-pascal[lsp-pascal], `lsp-mode`, `company` Emacs packages,
- Configure it like this in your `~/.emacs`:
+
[source,lisp]
----
(require 'lsp-pascal)

;; choose LSP server binary
(setq lsp-pascal-command "/home/michalis/sources/castle-engine/castle-engine/bin/pasls")

;; pass basic info to LSP server, all LSP Pascal servers above support these:
(setq lsp-pascal-fpcdir "/home/michalis/cge/tools/contrib/fpc/src")
(setq lsp-pascal-lazarusdir "/home/michalis/lazarus")
(setq lsp-pascal-pp "/home/michalis/cge/tools/contrib/fpc/bin/fpc-cge")
(setq lsp-pascal-fpctarget "linux")
(setq lsp-pascal-fpctargetcpu "x86_64")
----

=== NeoVim

The LSP server can be used with http://neovim.io/[NeoVim]. See the `client/nvim` subdirectory of https://github.com/Isopod/pascal-language-server/tree/master/client/nvim[Philip Zander\'s repository].

== Plans, TODOs

- Upload our extension also to https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium[VS Codium] marketplace. Note that fpDebug is not in VS Codium as of now, we'll likely fallback on different debuggger.

- Make the status bar shorter, following https://code.visualstudio.com/api/ux-guidelines/status-bar[VS Code status bar guidelines]. We know that current buttons may be "too much", esp. if you have already a number of other extensions filling the status bar. Ideally, we move (and add more) CGE functionality to a https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/tree-view[view (sidebar)] of VS Code, and in exchange make the status bar shorter.

- Show our API docs using VS Code popup, and available offline. This will replace the current approach to use a separate Webview (with pre-filled search).

- Bundle CGE with _VS Code_?
+
If you just install (unpack) CGE you should have a ready setup with CGE + VS Code. This is practically just _VS Code_ with automatically enabled (or suggested?) _"Castle Game Engine"_ extension mentioned above.
+
Of course we will still make everything such that you don't have to use this "bundled" VS Code and instead can use your existing VS Code installation, or really any other text editor / IDE, like Lazarus, Emacs, NeoVim etc.

- Can we have "Code Completion" (that happens in Lazarus when you Ctrl + Shift + C) that can automatically insert e.g. method declarations or complete property declarations?

- Debugging on macOS doesn't work yet.
