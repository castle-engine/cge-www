# Ideas For New Contributors

## Introduction

Ideas for people who wish to contribute to https://castle-engine.io/[Castle Game Engine].

NOTE: Originally this document was created for the https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[Google Summer of Code] program (to which we applied once but didn't qualify). But it makes sense in general, for all new people interested in contributing to Castle Game Engine!

## Make demo games

While our engine features numerous examples (over 100), we need demos that look more impressive. We want things that look more like a working game (even if using ready assets from the Internet) than a simple technological example of using this-or-that API method.

Doing a game is something we generally recommend to everyone, whether they intend to contribute to the engine or not. It's the straightforward way to learn the engine and use it how "it is supposed to be used". And have fun :)

Suggestions (for GSoC program, these are requirements): The demo must be fully open-source (both code and data). The demo must use latest CGE features, which means that:

- game should be organized into a number of link:views[]
- you should use link:editor[] as much as it makes sense to visually design UI and game world
- the code should be cross-platform, and have a chance to work on both desktop and mobile.
- Just follow any of the templates generated by _"New Project"_ in link:editor[], they setup things as we like.

Both smaller and larger demos are welcome.

- Smaller demos could be included in CGE examples folder, which means you would make a PR (pull request) to include your project as a new subdirectory in the `examples/` dir in https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/
- Larger demos may deserve a separate repository. For GSoC, we could create repos within the CGE organization, https://github.com/castle-engine/ . In general, you can naturally create your own repository on GitHub, and we can link to it from the CGE website, from https://castle-engine.io/gallery_games.php[Games using Castle Game Engine].

What exactly to do? Go ahead and run wild. We encourage you to use this opportunity and *just create a game you always wanted to make, and learn how to make games using CGE along the way, just try to have something complete (or at least, demoable) at the end of GSoC deadline*. Some ideas:

- 3D shooter like DOOM
- Top-down shooter, 3D or 2D
- RPG game in 3D with smooth movement or grid-based movement (see "dungeon crawlers", Wizardry, Ultima games)
- 2D dungeon exploration game (rogue-like with nice graphics)
- Car racing
- Adventure game - walking, talking, using objects
- ... any other game type you can think of. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_genres .

## Implement engine features

We have a number of features listed on link:roadmap[].

For people new to the engine, but otherwise experienced in programming, we would recommend to do some "integration" task that doesn't require a deep understanding of the engine internals, but rather requires to integrate the engine with a new API or technology. Examples

- https://castle-engine.io/roadmap#bgfx[BGFX renderer]. See starter project on https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/research_special_rendering_methods/new_renderer_skeleton/new_renderer_skeleton.lpr , "just" modify this to make calls to BGFX.
