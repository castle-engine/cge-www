# Google Summer of Code - Ideas
include::common.adoc[]

Ideas for students that wish to contribute to https://castle-engine.io/[Castle Game Engine] within the https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[Google Summer of Code]:

. *Demo games*. While our engine features numerous examples (over 100), we need demos that look more impressive. We want things that look more like a working game (even if using ready assets from the Internet) than a simple technological example of using this-or-that API method.
+
Requirements: The demo must be fully open-source (both code and data). The demo must use latest CGE features, which means that:

 ** game should be organized into a number of states (`TUIState`)
 ** you should use https://castle-engine.io/manual_editor.php[CGE editor] as much as it makes sense to visually design UI and game world
 ** the code should be cross-platform, and have a chance to work on both desktop, mobile etc.
 ** Just follow any of the templates generated by _"New Project"_ in https://castle-engine.io/manual_editor.php[CGE editor], they setup things as we like.

+
Both smaller and larger demos are welcome.

 ** Smaller demos could be included in CGE examples folder, which means you would make a PR (pull request) to include your project as a new subdirectory in the `examples/` dir in https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/
 ** Larger demos may deserve a separate repository within the CGE organization, https://github.com/castle-engine/

+
What exactly to do? Go ahead and run wild. We encourage you to use this opportunity and *just create a game you always wanted to make, and learn how to make games using CGE along the way, just try to have something complete (or at least, demoable) at the end of GSoC deadline*. Some ideas:

 ** 3D shooter like DOOM
 ** Top-down shooter, 3D or 2D
 ** RPG game in 3D with smooth movement or grid-based movement
 ** 2D dungeon exploration game (roguelike with nice graphics)
 ** Car racing
 ** ... probably any other game type you can think of.

. *Castle Game Engine Features*.
+
We have a number of features listed on link:roadmap[]. See also https://castle-engine.io/mobile_todos[mobile (OpenGLES) TODOs]. I list below various ideas, some of them require some experience with other APIs (like OpenGL or Vulkan).

 ** (EASY) Distance field fonts (see link:roadmap[] for some details).
 ** (EASY - if you have experience with macs) CastleWindow backend using Cocoa under macOS
 ** (MIDDLE) Terrain designer within CGE editor (see link:roadmap[] for some details, but the general idea is to match basic terrain editing tools from e.g. Unity).
 ** (HARD) Start Vulkan renderer. Using PasVulkan for bindings, most likely. See starter project on https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/research_special_rendering_methods/new_renderer_skeleton/new_renderer_skeleton.lpr , just modify this to make calls to Vulkan.
