This page documents _Castle Game Engine_ 7.0 new features. It's a work in progress -- as we work on making *final official CGE 7.0* released.

== Plans and Timeline

- We plan to release big version _7.0_ (stable) in 2024.
+
See https://castle-engine.io/roadmap[our roadmap] for more long-term goals (not just in 7.0).

- The most important feature *after* 7.0 release is https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/04/08/web-target-progress-and-plans/[the web target]. This will be our focus for the rest of 2024. Our hope is to have web target working around Christmas 2024 -- seems like a nice Christmas present :)

== Features released so far

All features below are already available. Download the engine from link:download[our download page] and enjoy them.

=== 7.0-alpha.3

* link:https://castle-engine.io/physics[Physics]
+
--
* New components (colliders and bodies)
* Running simulation in the editor
* API to use physics forces from code
* Joints
* Layers
* Updated 3rd-person navigation component that can now work with physics too
* A lot of new examples, see https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/physics[examples/physics]
* See also https://castle-engine.io/wp/2022/12/29/summary-of-the-new-physics-capabilities/[news, where I tried and failed to provide a concise summary of what changed :)]
--
* https://castle-engine.io/vscode[Visual Studio Code integration]:
+
--
- Intelligent code completion and syntax highlighting for all Pascal code (not necessarily CGE projects).
- Integration with engine project building / running / debugging for Castle Game Engine projects.
- Packaged in one neat https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castle-engine-team.castle-engine[VS Code "Castle Game Engine" extension] with trivial configuration: just point it to your engine directory.
- The underlying https://github.com/castle-engine/pascal-language-server[LSP server] usefu also with Emacs, NeoVim and other text editors supporting LSP.
--
* Delphi:
+
--
* https://castle-engine.io/control_on_form[TCastleControl available now for Delphi VCL and FMX applications, in addition to existing Lazarus LCL].
//* https://castle-engine.io/download#delphinus[Delphinus support] (unfortunately not recommended anymore, due to https://github.com/Memnarch/Delphinus/issues/93 and https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/issues/84 )
* Full support tested for Delphi >= 10.2.1, up to the latest 12.0 (see https://castle-engine.io/delphi[Delphi versions supported]).
* https://castle-engine.io/delphi#cpp_builder[{cpp} Builder compatibility], so you can use 100% of CGE API from {cpp}.
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/11/05/asynchronous-downloading-using-tcastledownload-for-delphi/[TCastleDownload for Delphi supports http(s)]
* Using Delphi _"welcome page"_ feature to show your `README.md`
* _"Tools -> Castle Game Engine"_ menu in Delphi IDE, with easy access to main engine tools. See https://castle-engine.io/wp/2024/02/23/new-delphi-packages-organization-and-tools-castle-game-engine-menu-in-delphi-ide/[news].
* New link:delphi_packages[Delphi packages] organization, cross-platform and future-proof.
* Full link:delphi_linux[Linux] support with Delphi, for both cgeref:TCastleWindow[] and cgeref:TCastleControl[], with almost all CGE examples compatible and entire CGE API fully supported.
--
* Easily activate https://castle-engine.io/wp/2022/10/03/easy-shadows-in-editor-at-design-time-too-by-shadow-volumes-and-shadow-maps-are-coming-as-well/[shadows], just select checkbox `Shadows` at the light source to use shadow volumes.
+
--
* By default only shapes that are 2-manifold are valid shadow casters.
* You can also force to treat the whole scene as 2-manifold (useful when its 2-manifold when you sum all shapes, and shapes can use different materials) using cgeref:TCastleRenderOptions.WholeSceneManifold[].
* Note: We plan to expose also our _shadow maps_ in a similar easy-to-use fashion in future releases.
* Both shadow volumes and shadows maps work on mobile (OpenGLES) too.
--
* New component to support https://castle-engine.io/tiled_maps[Tiled maps]:
+
--
* Part of the viewport (can be mixed with CGE scenes, sprite sheets...),
* Excellent performance to render huge maps.
* Configurable layers.
* Examples on https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/tiled[examples/tiled/] upgraded, in particular we feature a complete playable turn-based strategy game.
--
* Renderer improvements:
+
--
* Correct and automatic blending sorting. Read https://castle-engine.io/blending[blending documentation] and https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/06/30/big-renderer-improvements-correct-and-automatic-blending-sorting-more-powerful-batching-now-cross-scene-easier-and-more-reliable-occlusion-culling-and-occlusion-sorting/[news 1] and https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/07/22/blending-and-billboards-new-options-better-defaults-to-make-various-cases-work-out-of-the-box/[news 2] to understand the details. But the gist is that it now works much more "out of the box" in both 3D and 2D typical game scenarios.
* Batching is easier to use (just flip cgeref:TCastleViewport.DynamicBatching[], observe the `MyViewport.Statistics.ToString` to learn if you achieved any performance improvement). And it is more powerful -- it can now batch across the scenes and can batch more things, e.g. cgeref:TCastleImageTransform[] with the same image will be nicely batched and rendered using one _"draw call"_.
* Occlusion culling is also simpler to use: flip cgeref:TCastleViewport.OcclusionCulling[]. See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/viewport_and_scenes/occlusion_culling[examples/viewport_and_scenes/occlusion_culling] for demo.
* OpenGLES supports now almost all desktop rendering features: shadow volumes, shadow maps, 3D textures, occlusion query, anisotropic filtering, meshes with 32-bit indexes.
* Using only modern OpenGL 3.x context features, if possible.
* Using "core" OpenGL profile on macOS by default, thus having OpenGL 4.x API on macOS
* More optimal drawing of line primitives and quads.
* cgeref:TCastleRenderUnlitMesh[] utility.
* Fixes for older ATI GPUs.
* New projects automatically contain code to use link:dedicated_gpu[dedicated GPU] (important on laptops with dual GPUs).
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2022/11/12/tcastletransform-renderlayer-to-render-stuff-in-front-tcastlescene-precisecolisions-upcoming-plans/[TCastleTransform.RenderLayer to render stuff in front].
--
* User Interface improvements:
+
--
* Default fonts include a lot of common Unicode characters, so rendering text in local language in most cases will not just work "out of the box".
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2024/03/24/simple-user-interface-batching/[Simple User Interface Batching]
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/06/03/images-in-ui-regions-subset-of-image-and-visual-editing-of-both-region-and-9-slices/[Configure image regions and 9-slices borders]
* cgeref:TCastleMask[] (see https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/03/05/user-interface-features-render-with-mask-new-tcastlemask-component-better-slider-default-look-new-option-protectedsidesscaling/[news] and link:user_interface#_mask[manual] and https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/user_interface/mask[example]) to define a mask to limit rendering of other UI controls. Very powerful, as it can affect anything -- even viewports with 3D or 2D scenes.
--
* Many editor UX improvements. The most important ones:
+
--
* Modern color picker dialog to adjust colors as HSV, RGB, hex, show Pascal code, auto-apply. https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/04/15/editor-improvements-color-picker-display-statistics-simple-grid-and-axis/[News].
* Unified tools to edit UI and transformations in the editor, also with slicker icons.
* More reliable (much less often reloaded) hierarchy of components.
* Wireframe view.
* "Change Class" menu action.
* Dragging and dropping in the hierarchy preserves transformation by default (hold "Ctrl" to not preserve). Also dragging and dropping of multiple components is now possible.
* link:sketchfab[Sketchfab Importer]
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/06/03/images-in-ui-regions-subset-of-image-and-visual-editing-of-both-region-and-9-slices/[Visually edit images region and 9-slices borders].
* Property editors more comfortable, angles in degrees in editor (https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/07/16/improvements-to-property-editors-in-particular-display-and-input-angles-in-degrees-in-the-editor/[news])
* Component warnings, to warn e.g. if you have `TCastleRigidBody` without `TCastleCollider` or vice versa.
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2024/05/03/find-ctrl-f-find-next-f3-to-easily-find-components-by-name-useful-in-large-designs/[Find components by name (useful in large designs)]
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/08/18/automatically-reload-data-at-design-time/[Automatically reload data at design-time]
--
* Improvements around our https://castle-engine.io/views[views] (formerly _states_):
+
--
* Cleaner API to set / push / pop the view _on given container_.
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2022/10/16/published-state-fields-are-now-automatically-initialized-no-need-in-most-cases-for-designedcomponent-calls/[Published fields of a view are now automatically initialized].
* Editor greets you, when you open a project, with UX to open existing view, or create a new view. This communicates the recommended actions to user after opening a project, and emphasizes our focus on designinig you application around _views_. See relevant https://castle-engine.io/wp/2022/12/28/tuistate-is-now-tcastleview-methods-to-change-the-view-are-now-part-of-container-new-slick-ui-when-opening-the-project/[news].
--
* Mobile:
+
--
* Lots of https://castle-engine.io/android[Android] services improvements: Google Play Games, OpenAL, AdMob.
* https://castle-engine.io/castle-model-viewer-mobile[Castle Model Viewer Mobile] and https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8315026166336791468[more Android applications available] to demonstrate capabilities of our engine on mobile.
* Installation of tools is also simpler and better documented. See https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/08/06/android-upgraded-everything-google-play-services-openal-admod-api-level-gradle/[news].
* The on-screen keyboard on Android is automatically invoked when you focus a cgeref:TCastleEdit[].
* Lots of https://castle-engine.io/ios[iOS] fixes and improvements. As with Android, it takes some effort to keep up with the changes in the tooling (macOS, Xcode) and actual devices (iPhones, iPads) but we do this, so that you don't have to :)
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2024/08/02/mobile-android-improvements-safe-borders-new-ui-scaling-accounting-for-auto-rotation-nicer-better-gestures-with-tcastleexaminenavigation-modern-android-photo-services-improved-docs/[SafeBorders to position your UI such that it doesn't collide with system].
--
* Improvements around our installation process:
+
--
* On Windows and Linux, the engine download automatically includes a useful compiler (FPC 3.2.2) so that you can build CGE applications without the need to install anything extra.
* On Windows, we now have a self-extracting installer, that is simpler and faster than manually unpacking zip, and registers our engine editor in Windows menu.
* Raspberry Pi engine downloads for both 32-bit (Arm32) and https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/12/03/raspberry-pi-64-bit-downloads-officially-available/[64-bit processors] (Arm64 aka Aarch64) available officially. The Linux/Aarch64 versions are also tested on PineTab2, https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/12/13/castle-game-engine-on-pinetab2-linux-tablet-from-pine64/[a nice Linux tablet from Pine64].
--
* Loading and saving of models:
+
--
* Cache for scene loading: cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.Cache[].
* MD3 support improvements: multiple animations supported (we load `animation.cfg`), so playing particular MD3 animations is trivial, just use our `PlayAnimation` method. Optimized loading. Choosing skins. Support for tags. See https://castle-engine.io/md3[MD3 support docs], see https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/03/31/md3-support-improvements-multiple-animations-tags-configurable-skins/[news].
* X3D 4.0 support improvements, e.g. proper `MetadataXxx` `containerField` handling for both X3D 4 and 3, added new X3D 4.0 fields to various nodes.
* Register custom model formats using cgeref:RegisterModelFormat[] and cgeref:TModelFormat[]. The formats you register this way, can be loaded using cgeref:LoadNode[] or cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.Load[] and saved using cgeref:SaveNode[].
* STL saving (convert any model to STL). Saving to link:gltf[glTF] is coming.
--
* More important improvements without a clear category:
+
--
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2022/11/06/faster-compilation-with-cache/[Cache for faster compilation].
* Improvements to usage of https://castle-engine.io/reuse_design[TCastleDesign and TCastleTransformDesign]: context menu to them to edit, revert, and open a referenced design.
* Lots of documentation updates. Links to some pages not already mentioned above: https://castle-engine.io/custom_components[custom components], https://castle-engine.io/behaviors[behaviors], https://castle-engine.io/coding_conventions[coding conventions (extended with our guidelines about memory management, nil and more)] .
* Inspector (press F8 in a debug build of any project) improvements: https://castle-engine.io/wp/2024/07/11/auto-reloading-hot-reloading-when-the-game-runs-and-more-things-auto-reloaded-at-design-time/[hot reloading at run-time], https://castle-engine.io/wp/2024/07/13/inspector-f8-in-all-your-games-improvements-to-debug-tweak-inspect-your-game-at-run-time/[tweak boolean properties at run-time].
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2024/07/12/float-based-images-e-g-for-precise-terrains-full-support-4-float-based-image-classes-passed-to-gpu-and-shaders-loading-16-bit-png-loading-float-based-ktx-loading-16-32-bit-tiffs-castle-image/[Float-based images (e.g. for precise terrains) full support: 4 float-based image classes (passed to GPU and shaders), loading 16-bit PNG, loading float-based KTX, loading 16/32-bit TIFFs]

=== Released in 7.0-alpha.1: Expanded version

* https://castle-engine.io/manual_editor.php[Castle Game Engine Editor application!]
 ** Run it by simply executing "castle-editor" binary in the "bin/" subdirectory of our release zip.
 ** It comes with 4 templates for new projects: empty, 3D model viewer, 2D game, 3D FPS game. These showcase nicely editor possibilities and were designed as a good starting point for your applications.
 ** Editor allows to visually design TCastleUserInterface (like TCastleButton, TCastleLabel) and TCastleTransform (like TCastleScene) hierarchies.
 ** Editor also manages (creates, compiles) Castle Game Engine projects, using our https://castle-engine.io/build_tool[build tool] underneath.
 ** Integrated with our tools (runs link:castle-model-viewer[], link:castle-image-viewer[] etc. when double-clicking), can preview data (models, images, sounds).
 ** Runs a configured compiler: FPC or Delphi.
 ** Runs a configured Pascal code editor when double-clicking on Pascal files: Lazarus, Delphi, Visual Studio Code, custom (Emacs...).
 ** https://castle-engine.io/wp/2021/07/11/font-classes-upgraded-and-available-in-cge-editor/[Fonts], https://castle-engine.io/sound[sounds], and other non-visual components can be designed in the editor too.
 ** https://castle-engine.io/wp/2021/05/22/easy-text-in-3d-and-primitives-box-sphere-plane-cone-cylinder-components-also-upcoming-editor-plans-for-new-components/[Primitives like box, sphere, 3D text in editor] are available, esp. useful for easily designing.

* glTF 2.0 full support and realistic rendering upgrades.
 ** Including _Physically Based Rendering_ materials, unlit materials and textures. This is supported in both glTF and X3D formats. The X3D nodes follow new X3D 4.0 standard.
 ** Animation of transformations and skin.
 ** Metadata support (e.g. from Blender custom properties), can also be used to set colliders.
 ** See https://castle-engine.io/creating_data_model_formats.php for details of glTF 2.0 support.
 ** See numerous news for details: https://castle-engine.io/wp/2020/04/25/huge-optimizations-of-gltf-animations-pool-of-scenes-for-fps-game-limited-pbr-specular-glossiness-support/[1], https://castle-engine.io/wp/2020/04/19/lots-of-gltf-work-new-x3d-extensions-and-conversion-improvements/[2], https://castle-engine.io/wp/2020/04/11/fun-with-sketchfab-plugin-in-blender-testing-gltf-performance/[3],  https://castle-engine.io/wp/2020/04/11/testing-gltf-with-models-from-sketchfab-improved-per-vertex-rendering-from-gltf/[4], https://castle-engine.io/wp/2020/04/01/gltf-skinned-animation-in-castle-game-engine/[5], https://castle-engine.io/wp/2020/03/22/blender-exporters-upgrades-and-fixes-gltf-unlit-support-castle-anim-frames-improvements-loading-a-series-of-models-for-animation/[6], https://castle-engine.io/wp/2020/06/11/reading-punctual-lights-from-gltf/[lights].
 ** See https://castle-engine.io/wp/2020/03/07/physically-based-rendering-and-lots-of-other-lighting-materials-upgrades-in-castle-game-engine-and-x3d-4-0/[news specific about PBR (in glTF and X3D v4)]
 ** link:color_space[Color Space (Gamma Correction)].
* Nintendo Switch full support. See https://castle-engine.io/nintendo_switch
* Much better API for viewports and cameras.
 ** To display `TCastleScene`/`TCastleTransform` hierarchy, use `TCastleViewport`, always. It is a normal user interface control, you can set it's size/position as any other UI control.
 ** The concept of _camera_ (where are you looking at) and _navigation_ (whether we handle some keys/mouse to move the camera) was split. `TCastleViewport.Camera` is always created, and corresponds 1-to-1 to the parent viewport. `TCastleViewport.Navigation` is optional, you can explicitly create an instance of `TCastleExamineNavigation` or `TCastleWalkNavigation` and assign them there.
 ** Auto-detection of camera is by default off. This way you can reliably use `+Viewport.Camera.SetView(...)+` or `+Viewport.Camera.Translation := ...+`, without worrying that some auto-detection will override them. Use `Viewport.AutoCamera := true` to explicitly request this auto-detection.
 ** Auto-detection of navigation is by default off. This way you can reliably set `+Viewport.Navigation := ...+` (or leave it `nil` deliberately) without worrying that some auto-detection will override it. Use `Viewport.AutoNavigation := true` to explicitly request this auto-detection.

== Advise for upgrading: Upgrade your pipeline from X3D to glTF

While X3D is still our _scene graph format_ (which means that everything you render is composed from X3D nodes in memory, which practically means: Pascal classes `TXxxNode`), our main _file format_ is now glTF, not X3D (which means that we advise to export from Blender to glTF, not to X3D).

The reason for that is practical. glTF is just better now, as a file format:

* Although X3D offers a lot of features, but the existing Blender \-> X3D exporter is extremely poor. It doesn't support many features (e.g. it cannot export animations, or even textures in the latest version).
* Moreover, the existing Blender \-> X3D exporter doesn't support features which are CGE extensions or are only in X3D 4.0, like PBR or normalmaps. We had an extended CGE exporter (to X3D) for older Blender, but it was too much burden to maintain. We also had castle-anim-frames exporter, but castle-anim-frames is a poor solution compared to proper glTF skinned animation.
* Existing Blender \-> glTF is actively maintained (by Khronos together with Blender), and supports all the features we like. In particular PBR, all possible textures and normalmaps, unlit materials, animations by transformations, animations by skinning, by morphing, metadata (from Blender custom properties).
* glTF ecosystem is more active. By this I mean that great quality glTF models can be found e.g. on Sketchfab.
* glTF is much smarter about "binary data vs text data", which results in it being both simpler and more efficient. glTF uses a binary stream for data that should be uploaded to GPU (in particular everything per-vertex), and it uses JSON stream for other things. This makes glTF files much faster to load. In contrast, X3D text files encode 100% things in text (and thus are often huge and slow to load), unless one uses X3D binary encoding (which is not implemented in CGE, and probably will never be -- as it is still poor compared to glTF, as it only speeds up parsing but data still needs to be repacked for GPU).

So it seems reasonable to "just switch to glTF". I can now rely on Khronos to work on Blender \-> glTF exporter.

We advise you to use glTF for all your future games, instead of X3D, now.

You can, although you don't have to, switch your existing games to use glTF too. Of course we continue to support X3D model format in 100%, so you don't have to. Things to watch out for:

* In case of Blender, both the X3D exporter and glTF exporters convert (by default) "up" from +Z to +Y. However, they do it in a little different way. In effect, if you design a creature following Blender "front" convention, then it will look toward -Z direction after being exported to X3D, but in +Z direction after being exported to glTF. To be precise, X3D output is rotated 180 degrees around (0,1,0) compared to X3D output.
 ** For games using X3D exporter for creatures, call "TCastleTransform.DefaultOrientation := otUpYDirectionMinusZ". This was the default in CGE 6.4, but in CGE 7.0 the default is matching glTF convention, which is "TCastleTransform.DefaultOrientation := otUpYDirectionZ".
 ** If you switch your level models from X3D to glTF, remember to adjust any position you manually define (e.g. in code). Adjust it by rotating 180 degrees around (0,1,0). (For positions, you can just negate X and Z coordinates to achieve this.) E.g. camera or lights positions, if you ever define them in code.
* The glTF exporter will create materials using PBR (physically-based rendering). If you prefer to use Phong lighting model (because it is faster, or because it just looks better in your specific case) then you can define GltfForcePhongMaterials (global variable in CastleLoadGltf unit) before doing any loading. If you don't \-> remember that materials will just look different, and you need to manually adjust them (automatic conversion is not possible, as there are just different equations underneath).
