Rules when writing this:
- Try to fit things into categories, avoid desire to create category like "Other" or "Miscellaneous" to stuff remaining things.
- Avoid linking to news, that often become outdated over time. Prefer linking to manual with high-level overview. Eventually link to API docs.
- We do not mention explicitly "numerous examples" as a features, instead link to particular examples when sensible.

* XBox (we have the hardware -- even devkit, though _"developer mode"_ can also be activated on a retail version of Xbox).
--
* The engine code is portable and in principle "just works" on any operating system and CPU supported by FPC or Delphi.

== Visual editor

link:manual_editor.php[Editor] to visually design your game 3D and 2D world and user interface around it.

* With templates for new projects -- empty, 3D, 2D. They showcase nicely engine possibilities and were designed as a good starting point for your applications.
+
cgeimg::block[editor_new_project.png|New project templates in CGE editor]

* Allows to easily build the project for all platforms.
+
cgeimg::block[editor_platforms.png|Choose target platform,editor_formats.png|Choose package format]

* With file browser, with preview for data (3D models, images, sound files).
* With easy way to execute code editor (link:vscode[Visual Studio Code], link:lazarus[Lazarus], link:delphi[Delphi] or anything else you like) to edit your code.
+
cgeimg::block[code_editor_lazarus.png|Lazarus to edit Pascal code,code_editor_vscode.png|Visual Studio Code to edit Pascal code]

* Designs are (de)serialized to JSON. Any component can be (de)serialized, along with it published properties.
* Designs can refer to each other using cgeref:TCastleTransformDesign[] or cgeref:TCastleDesign[], to use them like _prefabs_ from other engines. See link:reuse_design[components to reuse a design in other designs].
* You can define link:custom_components[custom project-specific components available in the editor].

== Viewport with scenes, camera, navigation and other components

link:viewport_and_scenes[Viewport with scenes, camera, navigation] allows to define 3D and 2D worlds.

* Flexible hierarchy of transformations and scenes that you can design in the editor or control from Pascal code using a powerful OOP API.
+
cgeimg::block[viewport_3d_nice_view.png|Viewport with 3D design]

* Powerful cgeref:TCastleScene[] to load and render link:creating_data_model_formats.php[a lot of model formats, like glTF, X3D, sprite sheets].
* Other visible objects like cgeref:TCastleBox[], cgeref:TCastleSphere[], cgeref:TCastleText[], cgeref:TCastleImageTransform[]. Great also for quick prototyping 3D and 2D worlds.
* Flexible link:camera[camera] support, with multiple camera possible, attaching children to camera and placing camera as child of other objects, like bones.
* Easy link:navigation[navigation] components if you want to allow user to navigate in 3D or 2D worlds in a standard fashion. These include typical 2D and 3D navigation methods (like cgeref:TCastleWalkNavigation[], cgeref:TCastleExamineNavigation[], cgeref:TCastle2DNavigation[]) as well as 3rd-person navigation with avatar (cgeref:TCastleThirdPersonNavigation[]).
* Each transformation can be enhanced with behaviors (descendants of cgeref:TCastleBehavior[]), like cgeref:TCastleBillboard[], cgeref:TCastleSoundSource[]. It is easy and encouraged to create behaviors required for your specific game, see link:behaviors[Behaviors in the manual].
* cgeref:TCastleTransformReference[] to link:viewport_3d#_multiple_instances_of_the_same_scene_using_tcastletransformreference[efficiently reference the same transformation multiple times]. Great e.g. to instantiate thousands of trees.
* Lights using components cgeref:TCastlePointLight[], cgeref:TCastleDirectionalLight[], cgeref:TCastleSpotLight[]. See link:viewport_3d#_lighting[lighting in manual].
+
cgeimg::block[editor_lights.png|Lights in Castle Game Engine editor]

* Components to visualize terrains (cgeref:TCastleTerrain[]), and generate terrain data from smooth noise (cgeref:TCastleTerrainNoise[]) or image (cgeref:TCastleTerrainImage[]) or a combination of them (cgeref:TCastleTerrainCombine[]). See the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/terrain[examples/terrain].

* Great integration with link:blender[Blender] that can export to glTF.
* Lots of glTF models on the Internet, e.g. on https://sketchfab.com/features/gltf[Sketchfab].
* Skinned animation.
* _Physically Based Rendering_.
* Metadata support (which can come e.g. from link:blender[Blender] custom properties).

=== X3D

We support standard model format from Web3D: link:x3d[X3D and VRML].

* Support for X3D 4.0 with _Physically Based Rendering_ and lots of possibilities for shapes, textures, animations etc.
* The cgeref:TCastleScene[] is a set of X3D nodes. We implement link:x3d[extended set of X3D nodes].
* You can build and process scene graph of X3D nodes. Procedural generation of models, any pre/post-processing of models is possible.
* We can save the X3D graph back to file, in X3D or STL format, see cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.Save[], cgeref:SaveNode[].
* You can write model conversion utilities. Our link:castle-model-viewer[Castle Model Viewer] allows to convert various models to X3D and STL. Conversion to link:gltf[glTF] is coming.

=== Sprite sheets

We support link:sprite_sheets[sprite sheets].

* In _Castle Game Engine_ (`.castle-sprite-sheet`), Starling and Cocos2D formats.
* Own _sprite sheet editor_ to visually create sprite sheets from texture atlases.
+
cgeimg::block[sprite_sheet_editor.png|Sprite Sheet Editor]

* See the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/[platformer] example - complete platformer game using sprite sheets. Also https://castle-engine.itch.io/platformer[released on itch.io].
+
cgeimg::block[platformer.png|Platformer demo]

=== Spine

We support link:spine[Spine] skeletal 2D animations.

cgeimg::block[
  dragon_spine.png|Dragon in Spine,
  dragon_0.png|Same dragon rendered by Castle Game Engine
]

* We have own Spine importer in _Castle Game Engine_ that reads Spine JSON (not relying on any official _Spine runtime_).
* Spine animations and rendering features are converted to standard engine animation nodes (same nodes as used by glTF and X3D) so they play consistently within the engine, with animation cross-fading etc.
* Spine skins are supported.
* Loading Spine JSON files from various Spine versions, up to and including Spine 4, is supported.
* Spine texture atlases with all advanced options (e.g. stripping whitespace, rotating) are supported.
* Alternative: https://github.com/Kagamma/spine-runtimes/[Spine runtime for Castle Game Engine] is an alternative approach to load and render Spine models. It supports some additional features by "offloading" some work to the Spine C runtime.

== Graphic effects

* link:shaders[Shader effects] to define effects using GLSL that enhance existing engine rendering. See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/shaders/shader_effects_on_shape[examples/shaders/shader_effects_on_shape] example. You can write own effects easily using _OpenGL Shading Language_.
+
cgeimg::block[
  volumetric_animated_fog_all.png|Volumetric fog,
  barna29_nice_shadows.png|Real-time water with caustics\, reflections\, shadows

* link:x3d_implementation_cubemaptexturing.php[Easy mirrors on curved surfaces (using generated cubemaps)].
* _Physically-Based Rendering_ used by default for glTF and X3D 4.0 models using cgeref:TPhysicalMaterialNode[].
* Alternative _unlit_ shading also available, with glTF and X3D 4.0 models using cgeref:TUnlitMaterialNode[].
* Alternative "classic" Phong shading is also available using cgeref:TMaterialNode[] or cgeref:GltfForcePhongMaterials[].
* link:x3d_extensions_shadow_maps.php[Shadow maps] (with auto-detection of limits, correct shadows from multiple light sources).
+
cgeimg::block[

  sunny_street_tree_hard.png|Close up shadows on the tree. Notice that leaves (modeled by alpha-test texture) also cast correct shadows.
]

* link:shadow_volumes[Shadow volumes] (with z-fail / z-pass automatic detection, silhouette detection).
+
cgeimg::block[rift_2.png|Fixed-camera game]

* Screen effects (post-processing) API to define post-processing effects using shaders. See link:x3d_extensions_screen_effects.php[screen effects specification], you can add screen effects over any UI control: just place it as child of cgeref:TCastleScreenEffects[]. See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/screen_effects_demo/[examples/screen_effects_demo/].
+
cgeimg::block[little_things_screen_7.png|"Little Things" game with screen effects]

* link:color_space[Color Space (Gamma Correction)].
* Easily design link:background[background (with sky/ground gradients, skybox)], link:fog[fog].
* Multi-sampling (full-screen anti-aliasing), just set cgeref:TCastleWindow.AntiAliasing[].

cgeimg::block[
  rendered_texture_with_background.png|RenderedTexture,
  chinchilla_diffuse_prt.png|Precomputed Radiance Transfer
]

* Modern approach to _OpenGL_ and _OpenGLES_ usage:
+
--
* Using modern OpenGL (OpenGL 3.3 "core" profile).
* Possibility to use ancient OpenGL (even 1.1) if we have to. To support ancient, buggy systems or virtual machines. See cgeref:TGLFeatures.RequestCapabilities[] for information how to test it.
* We can leverage some OpenGL ES 3.0 features (for shadow maps, 3D textures, occlusion culling...), but any OpenGL ES 2.0 system works.
* On desktops we can use both OpenGL (default) and OpenGLES. On mobile, naturally only OpenGLES.
* Easy OpenGL debugging (cgeref:TGLFeatures.Debug[] allows to get rich logs and exceptions from GL).
--

== Images

Easily display link:using_images[display images] as user interface or in a viewport.

* Numerous image formats (like PNG, JPG, RGBE) supported thanks to the integration with https://imaginglib.sourceforge.io/[Vampyre Imaging Library].
* Full support for KTX and DDS that enable GPU texture compression, cubemaps and more.
* link:creating_data_auto_generated_textures.php[Automatic texture compression and downscaling].

== User interface components

cgeimg::block[inspector_design.png|Inspector UI,ui_image.png|Images]

// inspector_running.png|Inspector visible at runtime - removed, could be mistaken for editor

* link:user_interface[User interface] library providing cross-platform UI controls that work on all platforms, like buttons, labels, images.
* Their look can be adjusted to match the style of your game.
* Your game is organized into link:views[views]. Each view can have a design (created in editor) and an associated unit where you can link:view_events[handle various events, like a key press].
* Automatic UI scaling to adjust to any screen resolution and aspect ratio with anchors.
* Powerful masks: https://castle-engine.io/user_interface#_mask[manual], https://castle-engine.io/apidoc/html/CastleControls.TCastleMask.html[API reference], https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/user_interface/mask[example].

=== Text and fonts

* link:text[Rendering text in user interface and in 3D, with customizable fonts].
* Fonts can be loaded from common formats (like TTF or OTF, cgeref:TCastleFont[]) or images (cgeref:TCastleBitmapFont[]).
* Localization (including automatically translating user interface and ``resourcestring``s).
* UTF-8 support for all strings through the engine API, in particular to render text.

== Networking

The engine uses URLs, allows to download contents of URLs, and can be integrated with various networking libraries.

cgeimg::block[
  delphi_linux_downloads.png|asynchronous_download example\, downloading multiple URLs asynchronously (without blocking the UI),
  not_quake_1.png|"Not Quake" demo - real-time network game,
  mormot_example_screenshot1.png|Collaborative editing of 3D world using Castle Game Engine and mORMot2,
  server_and_2_clients.png|TCP server and 2 clients\, on Windows
]

* All paths are expressed as URLs with some special CGE protocols, see link:url[URLs, loading (downloading) and saving resources].
* Application data can be always accessed using link:data[URLs like `castle-data:/xxx`].
* You can download URLs asynchronously using cgeref:TCastleDownload[].
* Integration with link:multi_player#indy[Indy] (example client-server in https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/network/tcp_connection[examples/network/tcp_connection]).
* Integration with link:multi_player#mormot[mORMot 2] (example in our https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-and-mormot-collaborative-editing/[castle-and-mormot-collaborative-editing] demo).
* Integration with link:multi_player#rnl[RNL] (example in our https://github.com/castle-engine/not-quake[not-quake] demo).

== Optimization and profiling

We have extensive link:manual_optimization.php[optimization documentation] and a number of features to help you make your game faster.

* Inspector available under F8 in any debug game shows FPS profile and much more. It allows to inspect the current properties of all components, to tweak them at run-time, and even to https://castle-engine.io/wp/2024/07/11/auto-reloading-hot-reloading-when-the-game-runs-and-more-things-auto-reloaded-at-design-time/[hot-reload] assets at run-time.
* Built-in simple profiler cgeref:TCastleProfiler[].
* Built-in frame profiler cgeref:TCastleFrameProfiler[].
* Built-in texture memory profiler cgeref:TextureMemoryProfiler[].
* cgeref:DynamicBatching[] is available to batch multiple shapes, to conserve draw calls.

== Sound

You can play link:sound[sound], spatial (in 3D) or not.

cgeimg::block[
  sound_example_3d_game_source.png|3D game sound demo - TCastleSoundSource
]

* Supports for various sound backends: link:openal[OpenAL] or link:fmod[FMOD], on multiple platforms.
* Sound streaming is done, for efficient playback of music tracks.
* WAV and OggVorbis file formats are supported with all sound backends.
* Sound components cgeref:TCastleSound[] and cgeref:TCastleSoundSource[] can be designed and tested also in editor.
* Automatic sound source management based on priorities.

== Physics

cgeimg::block[
  physics_1.png|Bunch of physics rigid bodies,
  physics_mesh.png|Physics with mesh collider,
  physics_2d.png|Physics 2D
]

Use link:physics[] to calculate and react to collisions between objects.

* Define link:physics#_rigid_bodies_and_colliders[rigid bodies and colliders] on your objects. You can do it visually in the editor (and visualize colliders to make sure they make sense). Of course you can also set them up using code.
* Allow gravity and collisions to automatically have an effect.
* Test how physics behaves right inside the editor using link:physics#_physics_simulation_in_the_editor["Physics Simulation"] in editor.
* link:physics#_detecting_collisions[React to collisions by registering events]. Objects can also be __"triggers"__ if you only want to detect when something enters their volume.
* Set up link:physics#_joints[joints] that connect rigid bodies in some ways, e.g. to create a hinge.
* Physics is fully useful in both 3D and link:physics#_physics_simulation_in_the_editor[2D]. Consult our examples (in `examples/physics/`) for demos.
* Manually link:physics#_forces_pushing_rotating_bodies[apply forces to affect rigid bodies using physics], e.g. to make a character jump, or cause an explosion.
* Perform link:physics#_ray_casting_querying_for_collision[collision queries using physics], like "ray casts". Use e.g. cgeref:TCastleAbstractRootTransform.PhysicsRayCast[Viewport.Items.PhysicsRayCast].
* Organize objects in link:physics#_layers[layers] to limit what collides with what.
* Using https://github.com/BeRo1985/kraft/[Kraft Physics Engine] under the hood.
* _Deprecated_: We also feature an older system with (for now) a few more ways to query collisions. Just set cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.PreciseCollisions[] to `true` to make collision queries treat your scene as a precise mesh. Then use routines like cgeref:TCastleAbstractRootTransform.WorldRayCast[Viewport.Items.WorldRayCast] or cgeref:TCastleAbstractRootTransform.WorldBoxCollision[Viewport.Items.WorldBoxCollision] to query whether something collides.

== Tiled integration

You can design game maps using https://www.mapeditor.org/[Tiled].

cgeimg::block[
  tiled_editor_snow.png|Tiled snow map (with animations),
  tiled_editor_beach.png|Tiled beach map (with animations),
  tiled_3.png|Tiled isometric map,
  tiled_strategy_hex.png|Tiled hexagonal map in "Strategy Game" demo,
  tiled_strategy_iso.png|Tiled isometric map in "Strategy Game" demo,
  tiled_strategy_ortho.png|Tiled orthogonal map in "Strategy Game" demo
]

* Tiled maps (TMX files) can be loaded into cgeref:TCastleTiledMap[] for an efficient 2D or 3D display in a viewport.
* Viewport display means they can be combined with other scenes on top of it, like sprite sheets for units on the map.
* We support various map types (orthogonal, isometric, hexagonal), layers (you control which layers are displayed), animations and more.
* See https://castle-engine.io/tiled_maps[the manual about Tiled map].
* See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/tiled/strategy_game_demo/[examples/tiled/strategy_game_demo] for a complete strategy game in CGE using Tiled maps.

== Data and Systems

Developing games means dealing a lot with _data_ (assets). We have full-featured systems providing all the capabilities you need. They are the basis of our link:editor[] but are also useful at run-time to deal with your data while your application runs.

* Automatic packaging of link:data[data] files for all platforms, exposing them through `castle-data:/` URL.
* All the reading, writing, searching in our engine accepts https://castle-engine.io/url[URLs]. So you can use regular file-system (`file:/`), you can refer to files in your data (`castle-data:/`), you can refer to resources inside ZIP files, or even resources on the network (`https:/...`). You can easily register your own URL protocols (schemes) to extend this system.
* ZIP handling, supporting read and write, supporting all platforms and compilers, with optional URL protocol registration. See cgeref:TCastleZip[] and https://castle-engine.io/wp/2025/03/09/new-class-for-zip-handling-tcastlezip-progress-on-new-pretty-wireframe-approach-woff-fonts-support-lod-usage-demo/[news about ZIP].
* Loading and saving components (our engine components or any other Pascal `TComponent`) to JSON files. The base unit to do this is cgeref:CastleComponentSerialize[], and there are many things build "on top" of it, like our link:editor[], loading designs in views, https://castle-engine.io/reuse_design[reusing designs].
* Cloning the components using cgeref:TCastleComponentFactory[], cgeref:ComponentClone[]. See e.g. https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/space_shooter[examples/space_shooter] that uses a factory to spawn rockets and rocks.

== Particles

Particle systems are not *yet* part of the core _Castle Game Engine_ units. However you can use additional open-source components that add this capability to the engine:

cgeimg::block[
  particles_2.webp|Particles,
  particles_3.webp|Particles,
  particles_4.webp|Particles
]
//  particles_1.webp|Particles,
//   particles_5.webp|Particles

* https://github.com/Kagamma/cge-3d-particle-emitter[Particle Emitter]: Particle system for 3D and 2D that supports editing right inside CGE editor. Particles are calculated with GPU acceleration (transform feedback). By _Trung Le (Kagamma)_.
+
cgeimg::block[cge_3d_particles_editor.png|Particles editor]

* https://github.com/Kagamma/cge-effekseer[Effekseer Integration]: Integration with https://effekseer.github.io/en/[Effekseer], a full-featured open-source particle effect creation tool. Also by _Trung Le (Kagamma)_.
+
cgeimg::block[cge_effekseer.png|Effekseer Integration]

== Native and fast code using modern Pascal

The engine, as well as your games, are written using link:why_pascal[modern Object Pascal].

cgeimg::block[combined_fpc_delphi.png|FPC\, Delphi\, Visual Studio Code]

* We maintain a link:modern_pascal[modern Object Pascal introduction] book to learn the language and link:learn_pascal[link to many more learning resources].
* We support https://www.freepascal.org/[FPC] and https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/[Delphi] compilers, see link:supported_compilers.php[Supported compilers and IDEs].
* Pascal as a programming language is
+
--
* elegant (type-safe, OOP, generics),
* full-featured (big existing codebases can be used, e.g. Pascal and C, C++ libraries to connect your games with database, AI, networking),
* native (compiled to native code that runs fast out-of-the-box).

// (or other features that cause _name mangling_ when being compiled)
you generally need to write a _"wrapper"_ library that exposes the equivalent API in plain C.
//The wrapper is compiled with a {cpp} compiler (which is the only compiler that can reliably "understand" how to link with {cpp} classes) to compile a wrapper library that exposes plain C API and then from Pascal you access plain C API.
This is exactly the same as trying to use {cpp} library e.g. from C#.
//The only thing essentially standardized, at binary level, across all compilers of various languages, is how the _plain C API_ is used.

* The same programming language that is used to make the engine is used for your applications -- this results in simplicity (it's easy to contribute) and speed.
* Fast execution. It's a language that compiles to fast native code, while staying elegant and type-safe.
* Fast compilation.
* Native debugging. It's just a native application using native debugger. Debugging is integral part of the https://www.lazarus-ide.org/[Lazarus IDE].

== Build tool and continuous integration

link:build_tool[Build tool] to manage your project from the command-line or in batch mode (good for continuous integration). The build tool, just like editor, reads project information from link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml] file.

* Build tool can build, package, run your application and link:creating_data_auto_generated_textures.php[autogenerate compressed textures] (and more).
* You can build for any supported target platform. You may need to install cross-compiler (e.g. using link:fpcupdeluxe[]), some platforms may also require additional tools (see their docs like link:android[Android]).
* We can build ready applications, like APK / AAB for Android, IPA for iOS.
* link:docker[Docker image] with CGE and prerequisites (FPC, Android build tools, texture processing tools) to easily build CGE applications.
* Ready instructions to automatically build CGE projects using:

== Free open-source software

The engine is licensed on _"LGPL with static linking exception"_ license, similar to FPC and Lazarus standard libraries.

* In short it means that you *can* create proprietary, closed-source, commercial applications with it without any issues.
* See link:license[] for details.
