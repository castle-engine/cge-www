Rules when writing this:
- Try to fit things into categories, avoid desire to create category like "Other" or "Miscellaneaous" to stuff remaining things.
- Avoid linking to news, that often become outdated over time. Prefer linking to manual with high-level overview. Eventually link to API docs.
- We do not mention explicitly "numerous examples" as a features, instead link to particular examples when sensible.

* The engine code is portable and in principle "just works" on any operating system and CPU supported by FPC or Delphi.

== Visual editor

link:manual_editor.php[Editor] to visually design your game 3D and 2D world and user interface around it.

* With templates for new projects -- empty, 3D, 2D. They showcase nicely engine possibilities and were designed as a good starting point for your applications.
+
cgeimg::block[editor_new_project.png|New project templates in CGE editor]

* Allows to easily build the project for all platforms.
+
cgeimg::block[editor_platforms.png|Choose target platform,editor_formats.png|Choose package format]

+
cgeimg::block[code_editor_lazarus.png|Lazarus to edit Pascal code,code_editor_vscode.png|Visual Studio Code to edit Pascal code]

* Designs are (de)serialized to JSON. Any component can be (de)serialized, along with it published properties.
* Designs can refer to each other using cgeref:TCastleTransformDesign[] or cgeref:TCastleDesign[], to use them like _prefabs_ from other engines. See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/advanced_editor/advanced_loading_designs[examples/advanced_editor/advanced_loading_designs].
* You can define link:custom_components[custom project-specific components available in the editor].

== Viewport with scenes, camera, navigation and other components

link:viewport_and_scenes[Viewport with scenes, camera, navigation] allows to define 3D and 2D worlds.

* Flexible hierarchy of transformations and scenes that you can design in the editor or control from Pascal code using a powerful OOP API.
+
cgeimg::block[viewport_3d_nice_view.png|Viewport with 3D design]

* Powerful cgeref:TCastleScene[] to load and render link:creating_data_model_formats.php[a lot of model formats, like glTF, X3D, sprite sheets].
* Other visible objects like cgeref:TCastleBox[], cgeref:TCastleSphere[], cgeref:TCastleText[], cgeref:TCastleImageTransform[]. Great also for quick prototyping 3D and 2D worlds.
* Flexible link:camera[camera] support, with multiple camera possible, attaching children to camera and placing camera as child of other objects, like bones.
* Easy link:navigation[navigation] components if you want to allow user to navigate in 3D or 2D worlds in a standard fashion. These include typical 2D and 3D navigation methods (like cgeref:TCastleWalkNavigation[], cgeref:TCastleExamineNavigation[], cgeref:TCastle2DNavigation[]) as well as 3rd-person navigation with avatar (cgeref:TCastleThirdPersonNavigation[]).
* Each transformation can be enhanced with behaviors (descendants of cgeref:TCastleBehavior[]), like cgeref:TCastleBillboard[], cgeref:TCastleSoundSource[]. It is easy and encouraged to create behaviors required for your specific game, see link:behaviors[Behaviors in the manual].
* cgeref:TCastleTransformReference[] to link:viewport_3d#_multiple_instances_of_the_same_scene_using_tcastletransformreference[efficiently reference the same transformation multiple times]. Great e.g. to instantiate thousands of trees.
* Lights using components cgeref:TCastlePointLight[], cgeref:TCastleDirectionalLight[], cgeref:TCastleSpotLight[]. See link:viewport_3d#_lighting[lighting in manual].
+
cgeimg::block[editor_lights.png|Lights in Castle Game Engine editor]

* Components to visualize terrains (cgeref:TCastleTerrain[]), and generate terrain data from smooth noise (cgeref:TCastleTerrainNoise[]) or image (cgeref:TCastleTerrainImage[]) or a combination of them (cgeref:TCastleTerrainCombine[]). See the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/terrain[examples/terrain].

* Lots of glTF models on the Internet, e.g. on https://sketchfab.com/features/gltf[Sketchfab].
* Skinned animation.
* _Physically Based Rendering_.
* Metadata support (which can come e.g. from link:blender[Blender] custom properties).

=== X3D

We support standard model format from Web3D: link:vrml_x3d.php[X3D and VRML].

* Support for X3D 4.0 with _Physically Based Rendering_ and lots of possibilities for shapes, textures, animations etc.
* The cgeref:TCastleScene[] is a set of X3D nodes. We implement link:vrml_x3d.php[extended set of X3D nodes].
* You can build and process scene graph of X3D nodes. Procedural generation of models, any pre/post-processing of models is possible.
* We can save the X3D graph back to file in X3D format, see cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.Save[], cgeref:SaveNode[].
* You can write model conversion utilities. Our link:view3dscene.php[view3dscene] allows to convert various models to X3D.

=== Sprite sheets

We support link:sprite_sheets[sprite sheets].

* In _Castle Game Engine_ (`.castle-sprite-sheet`), Starling and Cocos2D formats.
* Own _sprite sheet editor_ to visually create sprite sheets from texture atlases.
+
cgeimg::block[sprite_sheet_editor.png|Sprite Sheet Editor]

+
cgeimg::block[platformer.png|Platformer demo]

=== Spine

We support link:spine[Spine] skeletal 2D animations.

cgeimg::block[
  dragon_spine.png|Dragon in Spine,
  dragon_0.png|Same dragon rendered by Castle Game Engine
]

* We have own Spine importer in _Castle Game Engine_ that reads Spine JSON (not relying on any official _Spine runtime_).
* Spine animations and rendering features are converted to standard engine animation nodes (same nodes as used by glTF and X3D) so they play consistently within the engine, with animation cross-fading etc.
* Spine skins are suported.
* Loading Spine JSON files from various Spine versions, up to and including Spine 4, is supported.
* Spine texture atlases with all advanced options (e.g. stripping whitespace, rotating) are suported.
* Alternative: https://github.com/Kagamma/spine-runtimes/[Spine runtime for Castle Game Engine] is an alternative approach to load and render Spine models. It supports some additional features by "offloading" some work to the Spine C runtime.

== Graphic effects

* link:compositing_shaders.php[Compositing shaders] to define shader effects that enhance existing engine rendering. See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/viewport_and_scenes/shader_effects[examples/viewport_and_scenes/shader_effects] example. You can write own effects easily using _OpenGL Shading Language_.
+
cgeimg::block[

* link:user_interface[User interface] library providing cross-platform UI controls that work on all platforms, like buttons, labels, images.
* Their look can be adjusted to match the style of your game.
* Your game is organized into link:views[views]. Each view can have a design (created in editor) and an associated unit where you can link:view_events[handle various events, like a key press].
* Automatic UI scaling to adjust to any screen resolution and aspect ratio with anchors.

=== Text and fonts

* link:manual_text.php[Rendering text in user interface and in 3D, with customizable fonts].
* Fonts can be loaded from common formats (like TTF or OTF, cgeref:TCastleFont[]) or images (cgeref:TCastleBitmapFont[]).
* Localization (including automatically translating user interface and ``resourcestring``s).
* UTF-8 support for all strings through the engine API, in particular to render text.

== Networking

The engine uses URLs, allows to download contents of URLs, and can be integrated with various networking libraries.

cgeimg::block[
  not_quake_1.png|"Not Quake" demo - real-time network game,
  not_quake_2.png|"Not Quake" demo - real-time network game,
  not_quake_3.png|"Not Quake" demo - real-time network game,
  not_quake_4.png|"Not Quake" demo - real-time network game
]

* All paths are expressed as URLs with some special CGE protocols, see link:manual_network.php[nerworking].
* Application data can be always accessed using link:manual_data_directory.php[URLs like `castle-data:/xxx`].
* You can download URLs asynchronously using cgeref:TCastleDownload[].
* Integration with link:manual_network.php#section_indy[Indy].
* An example integration with link:manual_network.php#section_rnl[RNL] is in our https://github.com/castle-engine/not-quake[not-quake] demo.

== Optimization and profiling

We have extensive link:manual_optimization.php[optimization documentation] and a number of features to help you make your game faster.

* Inspector available under F8 in any debug game shows FPS profile.
* Built-in simple profiler cgeref:TCastleProfiler[].
* Built-in frame profiler cgeref:TCastleFrameProfiler[].
* Built-in texture memory profiler cgeref:TextureMemoryProfiler[].
* cgeref:DynamicBatching[] is available to batch multiple shapes, to conserve draw calls.

== Sound

You can play link:manual_sound.php[sound], spatial (in 3D) or not.

cgeimg::block[
  sound_example_3d_game_source.png|3D game sound demo - TCastleSoundSource
]

* Supports for various sound backends: link:openal[OpenAL] or link:fmod[FMOD], on multipe platforms.
* Sound streaming is done, for efficient playback of music tracks.
* WAV and OggVorbis file formats are supported with all sound backends.
* Sound components cgeref:TCastleSound[] and cgeref:TCastleSoundSource[] can be designed and tested also in editor.
* Automatic sound source management based on priorities.

== Physics

You can use link:manual_physics.php[physics].

cgeimg::block[
  physics_1.png|Bunch of physics rigid bodies,
  physics_mesh.png|Physics with mesh collider,
  physics_2d.png|Physics 2D
]

* Define rigid bodies and colliders on your objects.
* Allow gravity and collisions to automatically have an effect.
* Register events on collisions or triggers.
* We use https://github.com/BeRo1985/kraft/[Kraft Physics Engine] under the hood.
* Coming soon (link:roadmap[]): designing colliders, rigid bodies and joints using code or by CGE editor. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNgBttV5DuA[teaser movie], https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/pull/394[1st PR].
* You can perform easily collision queries to determine... whatever you need. Just set cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.Spatial[] to at least `[ssDynamicCollisions]` to make collision queries treat your scene as more than just a bounding box. Then use routines like cgeref:TCastleAbstractRootTransform.WorldRayCast[Viewport.Items.WorldRayCast] or cgeref:TCastleAbstractRootTransform.WorldBoxCollision[Viewport.Items.WorldBoxCollision] to query whether something collides. Note that this, as of now, does not use the _"proper"_ physics engine (like _Kraft_ or planned _Bullet_), instead it uses custom octree implementation, but this will change in the future.

== Tiled integration

You can design game maps using https://www.mapeditor.org/[Tiled].

cgeimg::block[
  tiled_3.png|Tiled isometric map,
  tiled_strategy_hex.png|Tiled hexagonal map in "Strategy Game" demo,
  tiled_strategy_iso.png|Tiled isometric map in "Strategy Game" demo,
  tiled_strategy_ortho.png|Tiled orthogonal map in "Strategy Game" demo
]

* Tiled maps (TMX files) can be loaded into cgeref:TCastleTiledMapControl[] for 2D display.
* Or they can be loaded (work in progress) into cgeref:TCastleScene[] for 3D display and easy integration with other scenes on top of it, like sprite sheets for units on the map.
* See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/tiled/strategy_game_demo/[examples/tiled/strategy_game_demo] for a complete strategy game in CGE using Tiled maps.

== Particles

Particle systems are not *yet* part of the core _Castle Game Engine_ units. However you can use additional open-source components that add this capability to the engine:

cgeimg::block[
  particles_2.webp|Particles,
  particles_3.webp|Particles,
  particles_4.webp|Particles
]
//  particles_1.webp|Particles,
//   particles_5.webp|Particles

* https://github.com/Kagamma/cge-3d-particle-emitter[Particle Emitter]: Particle system for 3D and 2D that supports editing right inside CGE editor. Particles are calculated with GPU acceleration (transform feedback). By _Trung Le (Kagamma)_.
+
cgeimg::block[cge_3d_particles_editor.png|Particles editor]

* https://github.com/Kagamma/cge-effekseer[Effekseer Integration]: Integration with https://effekseer.github.io/en/[Effekseer], a full-featured open-source particle effect creation tool. Also by _Trung Le (Kagamma)_.
+
cgeimg::block[cge_effekseer.png|Effekseer Integration]

== Native and fast code using modern Pascal

The engine, as well as your games, are written using link:modern_pascal[modern Object Pascal].

cgeimg::block[combined_fpc_delphi.png|FPC\, Delphi\, Visual Studio Code]

* We support https://www.freepascal.org/[FPC] and https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/[Delphi] compilers, see link:supported_compilers.php[Supported compilers and IDEs].
* Pascal as a programming language is
+
--
* elegant (type-safe, OOP, generics),
* full-featured (big existing codebases can be used, e.g. Pascal and C, C++ libraries to connect your games with database, AI, networking),
* native (compiled to native code that runs fast out-of-the-box).
--
* The same programming language that is used to make the engine is used for your applications -- this results in simplicity (it's easy to contribute) and speed.
* Fast execution. It's a language that compiles to fast native code, while staying elegant and type-safe.
* Fast compilation.
* Native debugging. It's just a native application using native debugger. Debugging is integral part of the https://www.lazarus-ide.org/[Lazarus IDE].

== Build tool and continuous integration

link:build_tool[Build tool] to manage your project from the command-line or in batch mode (good for continuous integration). The build tool, just like editor, reads project information from link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml] file.

* Build tool can build, package, run your application and link:creating_data_auto_generated_textures.php[autogenerate compressed textures] (and more).
* You can build for any supported target platform. You may need to install cross-compiler (e.g. using link:fpcupdeluxe[]), some platforms may also require additional tools (see their docs like link:android[Android]).
* We can build ready applications, like APK / AAB for Android, IPA for iOS.
* link:docker[Docker image] with CGE and prerequisites (FPC, Android build tools, texture processing tools) to easily build CGE applications.
* Ready instructions to automatically build CGE projects using:
+
--
* link:github_actions[GitHub Actions]
* link:gitlab_ci[GitLab CI]
* link:jenkins[Jenkins]
--
+
Enjoy modern _continuous integration_, for free, however you host your code!

cgeimg::block[combined_osi_ci_logos.png|Open source\, integration with Jenkins\, integration with GitHub Actions]

== Free open-source software

The engine is licensed on _"LGPL with static linking exception"_ license, similar to FPC and Lazarus standard libraries.

* In short it means that you *can* create commercial closed-source applications with it without any issues.
* See link:license[] for details.
