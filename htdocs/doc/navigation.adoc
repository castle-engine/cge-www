# Navigation
include::common.adoc[]

//## Introduction

_Navigation_ handles user input (key presses, mouse movement, touches on mobile devices, ...) to control the camera.

To use a navigation, just create and add the navigation component as a child of cgeref:TCastleViewport[]. You can control the `Exists` property of the navigation to enable / disable it.

As cgeref:TCastleNavigation[] class is abstract, you actually have to use some descendant of it, like:

- cgeref:TCastleWalkNavigation[] - typical first-person 3D navigation. Depending on the cgeref:TCastleWalkNavigation.Gravity[] value, it feels more like _walking_ (when `Gravity` is `true`) or _flying_ (when `Gravity` is `false`).

- cgeref:TCastleExamineNavigation[] - inspect the 3D model, moving and rotating it to easily look at every side.

- cgeref:TCastle2DNavigation[] - specialized navigation for 2D. Makes it easy to move a 2D world, without accidentally making a rotation that would reveal it is 3D.

- cgeref:TCastleThirdPersonNavigation[] - 3rd-person navigation in which an avatar of the player is shown. This navigation requires an animater avatar to use, see https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/third_person_camera[examples/third_person_camera] how to set it up.

You have complete freedom how do you handle the input in your games. You can:

* use one of our ready navigation classes listed above,

* or implement a new descendant of cgeref:TCastleNavigation[],

* or implement navigation simply by processing the keys and updating the camera position / rotation from anywhere you want.
+
For example, move the camera in response to user input in your `TStatePlay.Update`. Example code would be like this (see link:manual_state_events.php[manual about handling state events]):
+
[source,pascal]
----
procedure TStatePlay.Update(const SecondsPassed: Single; var HandleInput: Boolean);
const
  MoveSpeed = 10;
begin
  inherited;
  MyViewport.Camera.Position := MyViewport.Camera.Position +
    MyViewport.Camera.Direction * SecondsPassed * MoveSpeed;
end;
----

See the link:viewport_3d[Tutorial: Designing a 3D world] and link:viewport_2d[Tutorial: Designing a 2D world] to see the typical workflow how do you manipulate the navigation using the editor.

// Commented out: AutoNavigation is not advised anymore.

## Auto-detecting the current navigation

By default, the navigation type is not auto-detected. This means that you can set cgeref:TCastleViewport.Navigation[] to whatever feels good for your game. Or leave cgeref:TCastleViewport.Navigation[] equal to `nil` (default) to not have any navigation.

A more automatic approach is also available. You can set cgeref:TCastleViewport.AutoNavigation[] to let the engine auto-detect the most suitable navigation method for you, and set it as cgeref:TCastleViewport.Navigation[]. The suitable navigation instance will be automatically created and assigned. If the model set as cgeref:TCastleRootTransform.MainScene[Viewport.Items.MainScene] includes some X3D `NavigationInfo` node then it will dictate the navigation. The X3D `NavigationInfo` will also set some navigation parameters, like

- cgeref:TCastleNavigation.PreferredHeight[],
- cgeref:TCastleNavigation.Radius[],
- cgeref:TCastleNavigation.MoveSpeed[],
- cgeref:TCastleNavigation.ClimbHeight[].

We don't advise using cgeref:TCastleViewport.AutoNavigation[], unless you work with X3D models that have useful `NavigationInfo` values. In most cases, it is simpler to leave cgeref:TCastleViewport.AutoNavigation[] as `false`, and adjust the navigation properties in the editor.
