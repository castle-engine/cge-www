This section documents the larger X3D extensions
developed for the _Castle Game Engine_.

Try them!
Simply download link:castle-model-viewer[Castle Model Viewer] and
explore the link:demo_models[demo models] collection.
All these extensions and graphic effects are easy to use,
and available in _Castle Game Engine_ without the need to code at all.
It's just X3D, so you simply declare them in your X3D files, and engine
takes care of all the rendering and processing.

Not that the _smaller extensions_ are documented earlier,
alongside the respective X3D components.
Look at the _"Extensions"_ subpages of the _"Standard X3D Components"_.
