== Introduction

_Blending_ is the technique to render _partially transparent_ objects with real-time graphics. _Partially transparent_ objects mean that the algorithm accounts for transparency values between `0.0` and `1.0`, e.g. `0.25` or `0.5`.

////
While _Castle Game Engine_ tries to make it work "out of the box" correctly in usual cases, there are various edge-cases that require the developer and/or graphic artist to know how the algorithm works, and tweak something.
////

== Summary

Things should work out-of-the-box, but if you experience artifacts at rendering multiple _partially transparent_ objects in your game, customize the cgeref:TCastleViewport.BlendingSort[].

You can set it in the editor.

Read on to understand the details.

== Terminology

* _Transparency_ is a value in 0..1 range, where 0 means that object is opaque, and 1 means that object is completely transparent (invisible).
+
The X3D material nodes have a `Transparency` property, cgeref:TPhysicalMaterialNode.Transparency[], cgeref:TMaterialNode.Transparency[], cgeref:TUnlitMaterialNode.Transparency[].

* _Alpha_ says _"how much is something opaque"_, it is simply _"1.0 - transparency"_. So alpha = 0.0 is something "completely invisible", alpha = 1.0 is "something totally opaque".
+
When you provide an RGBA color (`TCastleColor`, which is just equal to `TVector4`) then the last (4th) component is _alpha_.
+
When you provide an RGBA texture, then it includes an alpha channel, i.e. alpha value for each pixel.
+
When you provide a texture without alpha channel (like RGB or grayscale) then it is always treated like _alpha is 1.0 everywhere_, i.e. it is fully opaque.

== How transparency works

=== Alpha testing

Engine can handle transparency using *alpha-testing*, which means that each rendered pixel is either fully opaque or fully transparent.

More precisely: at each pixel, we test the alpha of the _"resulting color"_. _"Resulting color"_ here comes from mixing material color, per-vertex colors, and texture colors. If the color's alpha is > 0.5 then the pixel is rendered (as if the shape was opaque at this pixel). Otherwise the pixel is not rendered (as if the shape was completely invisible at this pixel).

While _alpha-testing_ is a less capable algorithm than _blending_ (as alpha-testing cannot account for partial transparency), it also avoids some issues unavoidable with blending. E.g. alpha-testing works without any problems with https://castle-engine.io/x3d_extensions_shadow_maps.php[shadow maps].

Alpha testing is sometimes called _alpha clipping_ (e.g. in link:blender[Blender] UI).

=== Alpha blending

Engine can handle transparency using *blending*. This means that all partially-transparent shapes are rendered _after_ all other shapes (that are opaque or use alpha-testing). Moreover,

* The partially-transparent shapes are rendered with Z-testing but without Z-writing. This means that partially-transparent shapes that are behind opaque objects are hidden, but partially-transparent shapes behind other partially-transparent shapes are visible. This matches reality, as partially-transparent shapes never fully "obscure" stuff behind them, by definition.

* When the partially-transparent pixel is rendered, it is mixed with the existing screen color using the "blending equation". By default is it `screen_color.rgb = incoming_color.rgb * incoming_color.a + screen_color.rgb * (1 - incoming_color.a)`. This equation can be configured using cgeref:TCastleRenderOptions.BlendingSourceFactor[Scene.RenderOptions.BlendingSourceFactor], cgeref:TCastleRenderOptions.BlendingDestinationFactor[Scene.RenderOptions.BlendingDestinationFactor] and can be overridden per-shape using https://castle-engine.io/x3d_extensions.php#section_ext_blending[Appearance.blendMode].

* The partially-transparent shapes are rendered in back-to-front order (if sorting is active, which is the default, see below). That is because the default blending equation (see above) assumes such order.

//The "ordering shapes" stage means that each shape is treated as a whole.

Various shape sorting algorithms are documented at cgeref:TShapeSort[]. Basically, common cgeref:sort3D[] is intuitive _"distance to the middle of the shape bounding box"_. And common cgeref:sort2D[] is intuitive _"distance to 2D camera"_.

Beware: in some cases, partially transparent shapes may be concave and intertwined in various crazy ways in 3D. It may not be possible to strictly say "shape X is in front of shape Y", because they may be sometimes in front, sometimes behind each other, at each pixel of the screen. To have reliable _blending_ results keep partially-transparent shapes simple, preferably convex and using backface culling.


== How do we determine whether to use alpha testing or alpha blending

Engine makes the decision about blending per-shape.

In most cases, cgeref:TAppearanceNode.AlphaChannel[] explicitly says what to do.

If you use link:gltf[glTF] model format, this always has explicit information (never `acAuto`) whether to use alpha testing, blending, or treat shape as opaque.

If you use link:blender[Blender], you can explicitly specify alpha treatment at Blender material. It will be correctly exported to link:gltf[glTF].

cgeimg::block[blender_alpha_ui.png|Choose alpha in Blender]

If cgeref:TAppearanceNode.AlphaChannel[] is `acAuto` (this happens e.g. for X3D models):

The engine looks at material `transparency` field, and the texture's alpha channel. If `transparency` is > 0, or if the texture has non-trivial alpha channel (this is detected by analyzing alpha contents, see cgeref:TEncodedImage.AlphaChannel[] description), then we use blending.

[NOTE]
====
This auto-detection cannot be always right.

For example, the alpha channel detection at the image (cgeref:TEncodedImage.AlphaChannel[]) is a heuristic, with some alpha tolerance. And what happens when multiple textures are used, with different alpha channel? Or if you use GLSL shader code to set/modify alpha value (the engine never parses your GLSL code, so it doesn't know about it)?

The engine essentially makes an educated guess about the author's intentions.

To be clear what happens, we advise to always specify the alpha treatment explicitly. One easy way to do this is just to use link:gltf[glTF]. Or set cgeref:TAppearanceNode.AlphaChannel[] from Pascal.
====

== Sorting (for alpha blending)

The sorting of partially-transparent objects is controlled using cgeref:TCastleViewport.BlendingSort[].

By default it is cgeref:sortAuto[], which performs best sorting for 2D (cgeref:sort2D[]) if you have a typical 2D camera (orthographic looking along -Z), and best sorting for 3D (cgeref:sort3D[]) otherwise.

All possible sorting options:

- cgeref:sortAuto[] - Auto-detect and use either cgeref:sort2D[] or cgeref:sort3D[].

- cgeref:sort2D[] - Sort along the Z axis.

- cgeref:sort3D[] - Sort based on the distance from current camera, looking at bounding box.

- cgeref:sort3DOrigin[] - Sort based on the distance from current camera, looking at origin point (point (0,0,0) in local coordinates). This may be better than cgeref:sort3D[] in some cases because the origin point is sometimes more "persistent", e.g. animations or billboard orientation may change bounding box, but not origin point.

- cgeref:sort3DGround[] - Sort based on the distance from current camera, looking at origin point (point (0,0,0) in local coordinates) projected on Y=0 plane. This may be better than cgeref:sort3DOrigin[] in some cases because it ignores the object height for the sorting purposes.

- cgeref:sortCustom[] - Sort using custom comparer event, see cgeref:TCastleViewport.OnCustomShapeSort[] and cgeref:TShapeSortEvent[].

- cgeref:sortNone[] - Do not sort. This may be reasonable for simple world arrangements, when you manually ordered all shapes and all scenes to follow back-to-front order, or when you use non-standard blending equation that does not require sorting.


////
==== Manually doing sorting

An alternative to using cgeref:TCastleViewport.BlendingSort[] is to sort manually by an explicit call to a method cgeref:TCastleTransform.SortBackToFront2D[Viewport.Items.SortBackToFront2D] or more general cgeref:TCastleTransform.SortBackToFront[Viewport.Items.SortBackToFront].

You can also do it at design-time, from the CGE editor, using the _"Viewport -> Sort Items For Correct 2D Blending"_ menu item.

The drawback is that you have to do it often enough.

In case of 2D, you should call it always after:

- adding a partially-transparent object,
- or moving partially-transparent object in the Z (depth) axis.

Luckily, in 2D, the camera position doesn't affect the cgeref:sort2D[] sorting.

In 3D it is more difficult, and in general you should just sort every frame, which means that it will be easier to just rely on automatic cgeref:TCastleViewport.BlendingSort[] documented above.

== 2D drawing of primitives and images

If you draw using cgeref:DrawPrimitive2D[], cgeref:DrawRectangle[] etc. -- they automatically use blending when provided color has alpha < 1. They take blending factors (that determine the "blending equation" mentioned above) as explicit arguments.

If you draw using cgeref:TDrawableImage[] then it automatically determines alpha treatment looking at image contents and the cgeref:TDrawableImage.Color[]. You can override alpha treatment by cgeref:TDrawableImage.Alpha[] property, there are also properties to determine blending equation: cgeref:TDrawableImage.BlendingSourceFactor[], cgeref:TDrawableImage.BlendingDestinationFactor[].

The above routines are used by user interface rendering, e.g. by `TCastleButton` or `TCastleImageControl` rendering, so they follow the same alpha treatment. The cgeref:TCastleImageControl.AlphaChannel[] allows to control blending in case of `TCastleImageControl`, underneath it uses `TDrawabbleImage` to render.
