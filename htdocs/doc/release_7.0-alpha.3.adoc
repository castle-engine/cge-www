== Main News Announcement

_This release is dedicated to the late https://github.com/eugeneloza[Eugene] https://gitlab.com/EugeneLoza/[Loza]. I miss you, dear friend._

See the TODO[main news announcement here]. This page serves as a detailed release notes.

== Summary

We are proud to present a big new release of _Castle Game Engine_, with lots of new features, improvements and fixes. The new engine version is available for link:download[download] now.

The highlights of the release are below. For more details, see the link:release_7.0-alpha.3[full release notes]. The number of this release, _"7.0-alpha.3"_, is a signal that we're on our road to the big _7.0_ release (see link:roadmap[roadmap] and link:release[plans and timeline]).

_We appreciate your support of the engine https://www.patreon.com/castleengine[on Patreon]. There are also https://castle-engine.io/donate_other.php[other ways to support us] and if you're a company, we're open to cooperation (write to `michalis@castle-engine.io`). By 2024, Michalis Kamburelis, the lead engine developer, spent most of his life on the engine and doesn't plan to stop. Moreover, since May 2024, Michalis works on the engine full-time counting only on your support. So anything you can give is really appreciated!_

The most important new features are:

* link:https://castle-engine.io/physics[Physics]. New components for colliders and rigid bodies, ability to run physics simulation in the editor, joints, layers, new examples.
* Many rendering improvements: Correct and automatic blending, batching and occlusion culling - easier to use and more powerful, fully modern rendering but also better support for ancient systems with old GPUs.
* Also OpenGLES (Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch) rendering supports now almost all desktop rendering features: shadow volumes, shadow maps, 3D textures, occlusion query, anisotropic filtering, meshes with 32-bit indexes.
* link:shadow_volumes[Shadows using shadow volumes] are trivial to activate (work is under way to expose https://castle-engine.io/x3d_extensions_shadow_maps.php[shadow maps] in a similar easy-to-use fashion).
* https://castle-engine.io/vscode[Visual Studio Code integration]. Our own https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castle-engine-team.castle-engine[VS Code "Castle Game Engine" extension] with code completion and syntax highlighting for all Pascal code, and easy building / running / debugging of Castle Game Engine projects.
* link:delphi[Delphi] improvements: link:control_on_form[TCastleControl] available for VCL and FMX applications, link:delphi_packages[Delphi packages] with IDE support, link:delphi_linux[Delphi Linux support] and more.
* Support for https://castle-engine.io/tiled_maps[Tiled maps] with a new component that is comfortable to use and efficient.
* User Interface improvements: better default font, UI batching, image regions and 9-slices borders visually configurable, link:user_interface#_mask[mask component].
* Many editor UX improvements: modern color picker, unified tools to edit UI and transformations, wireframe view, "Change Class" menu action, link:sketchfab[Sketchfab Importer], finding components by name.
* Improvements to https://castle-engine.io/views[views] (formerly _states_): better API, automatic initialization of published fields, editor greets you with UX manage views.
* Mobile improvements: lots of link:android_services[Android services] improvements, https://castle-engine.io/castle-model-viewer-mobile[Castle Model Viewer Mobile] and https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8315026166336791468[more Android applications released on Google Play], lots of general link:android[Android] and link:ios[iOS] fixes and improvements to make porting your games to mobile trivial, safe borders.
* Loading and saving: cache, MF3 improvements, X3D 4.0 improvements, custom model formats registration, STL saving.
* Inspector (press _F8 / 3 fingers_ in a debug build of any project) improvements: tweaking boolean properties at run-time, hot-reloading at run-time to iterate on your graphics.
* A lot of new documentation and examples. We in particular recommend 2 tutorial articles introducing most important engine concepts: link:bad_chess[Bad way to play chess, aka 3D physics fun].

*Spread the word!*

We don't do marketing. Because we suck at marketing. Help us -- spread the word about this new release! Post about it anywhere you can. Talk about it in your communities -- online or in the _Real World_. Tell your family about it (they really want to know). Reuse this news post and screenshots freely.

Have fun everyone and thank you for using the engine.

== Details

* link:https://castle-engine.io/physics[Physics]
+
--
* New components (colliders and bodies)
* Running simulation in the editor
* Explicitly causing forces and impulses by Pascal API
* Joints
* Layers
* Ray-casting (querying for collision) using physics colliders
* Updated 3rd-person navigation component that can now work with physics too
* A lot of new examples, see https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/physics[examples/physics]
* See also https://castle-engine.io/wp/2022/12/29/summary-of-the-new-physics-capabilities/[the initial news about physics, where I tried and failed to provide a concise summary of what changed :)]
--

* Renderer improvements:
+
--
* Correct and automatic blending sorting. Read https://castle-engine.io/blending[blending documentation] and https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/06/30/big-renderer-improvements-correct-and-automatic-blending-sorting-more-powerful-batching-now-cross-scene-easier-and-more-reliable-occlusion-culling-and-occlusion-sorting/[news 1] and https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/07/22/blending-and-billboards-new-options-better-defaults-to-make-various-cases-work-out-of-the-box/[news 2] to understand the details. But the gist is that it now works much more "out of the box" in both 3D and 2D typical game scenarios.
* Batching is easier to use (just flip cgeref:TCastleViewport.DynamicBatching[], observe the `MyViewport.Statistics.ToString` to learn if you achieved any performance improvement). And it is more powerful -- it can now batch across the scenes and can batch more things, e.g. cgeref:TCastleImageTransform[] with the same image will be nicely batched and rendered using one _"draw call"_.
* Occlusion culling is also simpler to use: flip cgeref:TCastleViewport.OcclusionCulling[]. See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/viewport_and_scenes/occlusion_culling[examples/viewport_and_scenes/occlusion_culling] for demo.
* OpenGLES supports now almost all desktop rendering features: shadow volumes, shadow maps, 3D textures, occlusion query, anisotropic filtering, meshes with 32-bit indexes.
* Using only modern OpenGL 3.x context features, if possible.
* Using "core" OpenGL profile on macOS by default, thus having OpenGL 4.x API on macOS
* More optimal drawing of line primitives and quads.
* cgeref:TCastleRenderUnlitMesh[] utility.
* Fixes for older ATI GPUs.
* New projects automatically contain code to use link:dedicated_gpu[dedicated GPU] (important on laptops with dual GPUs).
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2022/11/12/tcastletransform-renderlayer-to-render-stuff-in-front-tcastlescene-precisecolisions-upcoming-plans/[TCastleTransform.RenderLayer to render stuff in front].
--
* Easily activate link:shadow_volumes[shadows], just select checkbox `Shadows` at the light source to use shadow volumes.
+
--
* By default only shapes that are detected as 2-manifold are valid shadow casters. We use the link:shadow_volumes[shadow volumes] technique to render shadows.
* You can also force to treat the whole scene as 2-manifold (useful when its 2-manifold when you sum all shapes, and shapes can use different materials) using cgeref:TCastleRenderOptions.WholeSceneManifold[].
* Note: We plan to expose also our _shadow maps_ in a similar easy-to-use fashion in future releases. See https://castle-engine.io/roadmap#shadow_maps[shadow maps plans]. We've done initial work on this.
* Both shadow volumes and shadows maps work on mobile (OpenGLES) too.
* See https://castle-engine.io/wp/2022/10/03/easy-shadows-in-editor-at-design-time-too-by-shadow-volumes-and-shadow-maps-are-coming-as-well/[news].

* https://castle-engine.io/vscode[Visual Studio Code integration]:
+
--
- Intelligent code completion and syntax highlighting for all Pascal code (not necessarily CGE projects).
- Integration with engine project building / running / debugging for Castle Game Engine projects.
- Packaged in one neat https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castle-engine-team.castle-engine[VS Code "Castle Game Engine" extension] with trivial configuration: just point it to your engine directory.
- The underlying https://github.com/castle-engine/pascal-language-server[LSP server] is useful also with Emacs, NeoVim and other text editors supporting LSP.
--
* Delphi:
+
--
* https://castle-engine.io/control_on_form[TCastleControl available now for Delphi VCL and FMX applications, in addition to existing Lazarus LCL].
//* https://castle-engine.io/download#delphinus[Delphinus support] (unfortunately not recommended anymore, due to https://github.com/Memnarch/Delphinus/issues/93 and https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/issues/84 )
* Full support tested for Delphi >= 10.2.1, up to the latest 12.0 (see https://castle-engine.io/delphi[Delphi versions supported]).
* https://castle-engine.io/delphi#cpp_builder[{cpp} Builder compatibility], so you can use 100% of CGE API from {cpp}.
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/11/05/asynchronous-downloading-using-tcastledownload-for-delphi/[TCastleDownload for Delphi supports http(s)]
* Using Delphi _"welcome page"_ feature to show your `README.md`
* _"Tools -> Castle Game Engine"_ menu in Delphi IDE, with easy access to main engine tools. See https://castle-engine.io/wp/2024/02/23/new-delphi-packages-organization-and-tools-castle-game-engine-menu-in-delphi-ide/[news].
* New link:delphi_packages[Delphi packages] organization, cross-platform and future-proof.
* Full link:delphi_linux[Linux] support with Delphi, for both cgeref:TCastleWindow[] and cgeref:TCastleControl[], with almost all CGE examples compatible and entire CGE API fully supported.
--
* New component to support https://castle-engine.io/tiled_maps[Tiled maps]:
+
--
* Part of the viewport (can be mixed with CGE scenes, sprite sheets...),
* Excellent performance to render huge maps.
* Configurable layers.
* Examples on https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/tiled[examples/tiled/] upgraded, in particular we feature a complete playable turn-based strategy game.
--
* User Interface improvements:
+
--
* Default fonts include a lot of common Unicode characters, so rendering text in local language in most cases will not just work "out of the box".
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2024/03/24/simple-user-interface-batching/[Simple User Interface Batching]
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/06/03/images-in-ui-regions-subset-of-image-and-visual-editing-of-both-region-and-9-slices/[Configure image regions and 9-slices borders]
* cgeref:TCastleMask[] (see https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/03/05/user-interface-features-render-with-mask-new-tcastlemask-component-better-slider-default-look-new-option-protectedsidesscaling/[news] and link:user_interface#_mask[manual] and https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/user_interface/mask[example]) to define a mask to limit rendering of other UI controls. Very powerful, as it can affect anything -- even viewports with 3D or 2D scenes.
--
* Many editor UX improvements. The most important ones:
+
--
* Modern color picker dialog to adjust colors as HSV, RGB, hex, show Pascal code, auto-apply. https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/04/15/editor-improvements-color-picker-display-statistics-simple-grid-and-axis/[News].
* Unified tools to edit UI and transformations in the editor, also with slicker icons.
* More reliable (much less often reloaded) hierarchy of components.
* Wireframe view.
* "Change Class" menu action.
* Dragging and dropping in the hierarchy preserves transformation by default (hold "Ctrl" to not preserve). Also dragging and dropping of multiple components is now possible.
* link:sketchfab[Sketchfab Importer]
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/06/03/images-in-ui-regions-subset-of-image-and-visual-editing-of-both-region-and-9-slices/[Visually edit images region and 9-slices borders].
* Property editors more comfortable, angles in degrees in editor (https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/07/16/improvements-to-property-editors-in-particular-display-and-input-angles-in-degrees-in-the-editor/[news])
* Component warnings, to warn e.g. if you have `TCastleRigidBody` without `TCastleCollider` or vice versa.
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2024/05/03/find-ctrl-f-find-next-f3-to-easily-find-components-by-name-useful-in-large-designs/[Find components by name (useful in large designs)]
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/08/18/automatically-reload-data-at-design-time/[Automatically reload data at design-time]
--
* Improvements around our https://castle-engine.io/views[views] (formerly _states_):
+
--
* Cleaner API to set / push / pop the view _on given container_.
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2022/10/16/published-state-fields-are-now-automatically-initialized-no-need-in-most-cases-for-designedcomponent-calls/[Published fields of a view are now automatically initialized].
* Editor greets you, when you open a project, with UX to open existing view, or create a new view. This communicates the recommended actions to user after opening a project, and emphasizes our focus on designing you application around _views_. See relevant https://castle-engine.io/wp/2022/12/28/tuistate-is-now-tcastleview-methods-to-change-the-view-are-now-part-of-container-new-slick-ui-when-opening-the-project/[news].
--
* Mobile:
+
--
* Lots of https://castle-engine.io/android[Android] services improvements: Google Play Games, OpenAL, AdMob.
* https://castle-engine.io/castle-model-viewer-mobile[Castle Model Viewer Mobile] and https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8315026166336791468[more Android applications available] to demonstrate capabilities of our engine on mobile.
* Installation of tools is also simpler and better documented. See https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/08/06/android-upgraded-everything-google-play-services-openal-admod-api-level-gradle/[news].
* The on-screen keyboard on Android is automatically invoked when you focus a cgeref:TCastleEdit[].
* Lots of https://castle-engine.io/ios[iOS] fixes and improvements. As with Android, it takes some effort to keep up with the changes in the tooling (macOS, Xcode) and actual devices (iPhones, iPads) but we do this, so that you don't have to :)
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2024/08/02/mobile-android-improvements-safe-borders-new-ui-scaling-accounting-for-auto-rotation-nicer-better-gestures-with-tcastleexaminenavigation-modern-android-photo-services-improved-docs/[SafeBorders to position your UI such that it doesn't collide with system].
--
* Improvements around our installation process:
+
--
* On Windows and Linux, the engine download automatically includes a useful compiler (FPC 3.2.2) so that you can build CGE applications without the need to install anything extra.
* On Windows, we now have a self-extracting installer, that is simpler and faster than manually unpacking zip, and registers our engine editor in Windows menu.
* Raspberry Pi engine downloads for both 32-bit (Arm32) and https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/12/03/raspberry-pi-64-bit-downloads-officially-available/[64-bit processors] (Arm64 aka Aarch64) available officially. The Linux/Aarch64 versions are also tested on PineTab2, https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/12/13/castle-game-engine-on-pinetab2-linux-tablet-from-pine64/[a nice Linux tablet from Pine64].
--
* Loading and saving of models:
+
--
* Cache for scene loading: cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.Cache[].
* MD3 support improvements: multiple animations supported (we load `animation.cfg`), so playing particular MD3 animations is trivial, just use our `PlayAnimation` method. Optimized loading. Choosing skins. Support for tags. See https://castle-engine.io/md3[MD3 support docs], see https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/03/31/md3-support-improvements-multiple-animations-tags-configurable-skins/[news].
* X3D 4.0 support improvements, e.g. proper `MetadataXxx` `containerField` handling for both X3D 4 and 3, added new X3D 4.0 fields to various nodes.
* Register custom model formats using cgeref:RegisterModelFormat[] and cgeref:TModelFormat[]. The formats you register this way, can be loaded using cgeref:LoadNode[] or cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.Load[] and saved using cgeref:SaveNode[].
* STL saving (convert any model to STL). Saving to link:gltf[glTF] is coming.
--
* More important improvements without a clear category:
+
--
* https://castle-engine.io/wp/2022/11/06/faster-compilation-with-cache/[Cache for faster compilation].
* Improvements to usage of https://castle-engine.io/reuse_design[TCastleDesign and TCastleTransformDesign]: context menu to them to edit, revert, and open a referenced design.
* Inspector (press F8 in a debug build of any project) improvements: https://castle-engine.io/wp/2024/07/11/auto-reloading-hot-reloading-when-the-game-runs-and-more-things-auto-reloaded-at-design-time/[hot reloading at run-time], https://castle-engine.io/wp/2024/07/13/inspector-f8-in-all-your-games-improvements-to-debug-tweak-inspect-your-game-at-run-time/[tweak boolean properties at run-time].
