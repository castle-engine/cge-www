## Introduction

Don't see the feature you need? link:talk.php[Tell us on the forum or Discord].

If you would like to see some feature implemented sooner, please link:https://www.patreon.com/castleengine[support the engine development on Patreon!]

## VR and AR

VR: link:wp/2022/01/16/oculus-quest-2-developer-mode-for-castle-game-engine-enabled/[Michalis has access to Oculus Quest since the beginning of 2022]. Port most likely using link:https://www.khronos.org/OpenXR/[OpenXR] (to include the widest possible range of devices using a single cross-platform API).

cgeimg::block[oculus.png|Oculus Quest 2: Developer Mode for Castle Game Engine enabled!]

AR: most likely using Android / iOS built-in frameworks, as these make AR widely available on modern phones.

## (IN PROGRESS - MOSTLY DONE) More visual editor

Extend our link:manual_editor.php[editor] with features mentioned on link:wp/2022/01/01/summary-of-2021-plans-for-2022/[2022 plans]. Remaining:

- Materials editing.

## More Delphi

See link:supported_compilers.php[about existing Delphi compatibility]. We plan to support more platforms with Delphi: Linux, Android, iOS...

## Load and animate glTF more efficiently

We should read meshes in a way that keeps binary layout of data in glTF, so that it is ultra-fast to load, and it is loaded almost straight from glTF to GPU.

Some modifications to CGE may be required here (CastleGeometryArrays will have to be made more flexible for this). New X3D nodes should be introduced, like `BufferGeometry` (same as X3DOM?).

We should also perform skinning fully on GPU, avoiding `CoordinateInterpolator` done on CPU.

## More physics

More physics engine integration. The details are listed in the link:physics[manual about physics].

**Layers started on branch https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/physics_layers[physics_layers].**

## (IN PROGRESS) WebGL (HTML5) support

Using FPC + WebAssembly, new target announced at the end of 2021.

Some parts may also be done using pas2js. Done most likely just "wrapper", and the majority can be done using WebAssembly.

_This is already in-progress by Trung Le (Kagamma)._

## (IN PROGRESS) Particle systems

With a designer. Example usage: blood, snow, rain, fire, smoke... 2D, 3D.

_This is already in-progress by Trung Le (Kagamma). Use link:https://github.com/Kagamma/cge-3d-particle-emitter[cge-3d-particle-emitter] or link:https://github.com/Kagamma/cge-effekseer[Effekseer Integration]. See link:additional_components.php[CGE components]._

## Steam integration, and engine available as Steam app

Official Steam integration in CGE, see https://trello.com/c/RNDjQhqe/71-steam-headers . We already used it for The Unholy Society, we want to either “just publish that approach” or propose a new, improved (without an intermediate “wrapper” library) approach.

We should also upload CGE as app to Steam.

## Release mobile view3dscene (as Android and iOS application)

link:https://github.com/castle-engine/view3dscene-mobile[This is almost done, thanks to Jan Adamec.] We need to release it :)

Associated with glTF, X3D and other formats that the view3dscene (and _Castle Game Engine_) handles. Available in the App Store / Google Play Store. For free or for 1 USD (not sure yet; but definitely without ads, I really dislike ads).

## Terrain designer

Easily design a height map (X3D cgeref:TElevationGridNode[] node, with trees, rocks, grass). Saved and loaded as an X3D file.

Implementing this feature will most likely be split into a couple of small releases:

- Edit the heights.
- Edit the grass and trees and rocks.
- Efficiently render huge amounts of grass and trees and rocks.

Implement nice shaders to show it, like link:https://www.getlazarus.org/videos/bareterrain/#learning_resources[this BareGame example].

_What we have now:_ The engine includes a unit `CastleTerrain` to generate terrains in various ways (most notably, from smoothed random noise). We have `examples/terrain/` demo to play around with it. We have the link:https://github.com/castle-engine/wyrd-forest["Wyrd Forest"] game that also uses `CastleTerrain`, and also includes a simple editor of terrain settings.

_What we need:_ Visual, interactive editor for the `ElevationGrid` (the thing you get from `TTerrain.Node` call). To make hills, valleys in a comfortable way. And comfortably plant there stuff (rocks, grass, trees...).

## Ready components to replicate data over the Internet

Allowing to trivially get multi-playter functionality in your games.

## Vulkan renderer

Vulkan renderer.

We have a simple example code that shows how you can start a new renderer: see link:https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/research_special_rendering_methods/new_renderer_skeleton/[examples/research_special_rendering_methods/new_renderer_skeleton/].

## Make TCastleScene, TCastleTranform and friends to be special X3D nodes

This would make the whole TCastleViewport.Items a single graph of X3D nodes, allowing for more sharing in code. The TCastleTranform would be just like TTransformNode, but a little diferently optimized (but it would become toggable at runtime).

### Related to above: Possibility to reorder/merge all shapes, across all scenes

This would mean

- you no longer need to do link:blending.adoc[manual sorting] to have blending work correctly across scenes.

- the cgeref:DynamicBatching[] can merge shapes even from different scenes.

## Distance field fonts

See link:https://libgdx.com/wiki/graphics/2d/fonts/distance-field-fonts[about Distance field fonts]. See code from link:https://github.com/neurolabusc/OpenGLCoreTutorials[Chris Rorden] showing how to do it in Lazarus.

## Make 100% rendering features available on OpenGLES too

link:mobile_todos[We have some small TODOs to make OpenGLES (mobile) renderer as capable as OpenGL (desktop).]

## macOS: Package engine as one big application bundle

This will:

- be simpler to users, as the engine will be "one single application" for macOS users.

- avoid troubles resulting from Apple translocation. It right now prevents the CGE editor from detecting CGE path.

- avoid current duplication of `castle-editor/data` in distributed package, thus making it smaller by ~60 MB.

See link:macos[macOS].

## macOS: Have signed app bundle for the editor

This will allow to run CGE editor on macOS by just double-clicking it, out-of-the-box.

See link:macos[macOS].

We should also enable developers to easily sign their own applications packaged with CGE build tool.

## (IN PROGRESS) fps_game should be redesigned using editor, CreatureCreatures / CastleResources / CastleLevels / CastleItems / CastlePlayer should be replaced with a better API

**In progress. See https://castle-engine.io/wp/2022/10/21/concept-art-teaser-huge-graphical-and-functional-upgrade-to-our-fps-game-is-coming/[news post]. On branch https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/fps-game-upgrade[fps-game-upgrade].**

These 5 units (CreatureCreatures / CastleResources / CastleLevels / CastleItems / CastlePlayer) expose a high-level API, that sits on top on existing classes (like TCastleScene and TCastleTransform). But I am not 100% happy with their API. Reasons:

- The API is too specialized at some points (3D games with creatures / items pickable),

- It is confusing how it maps to API underneath (e.g. TPlayer somewhat controls the TCastleNavigation).

Gradually I will want to express their features in different ways, in ways that are more closely and obviously connected with TCastleScene / TCastleViewport / TCastleNavigation. Basically, I'm very happy with current API of TCastleScene and TCastleTransform, and I want to make it more obvious how it is related to creatures/placeholders and other concepts introduced in CastleLevels and CastleCreatures and CastkeResources. Currently they use TCastleScene and TCastleTransform inside, but the relationship is non-obvious.

It's not going to happen any time soon, but it will happen gradually, over the course of next 1 or more years. That is, some of the features of the 5 units mentioned above will become available in other ways too (more flexible, and more obviously connected to TCastleScene).

I know this sounds vague, because I have not yet clarified these plans in my head:) These 5 units *are* useful, they provide various features on top of TCastleScene. I'm not going to just "ditch" them or even deprecate them, before I made a better API that also has these features. For example:

- New TCastleScene.Load should be able to take a callback (or some class instance) to easily perform the "placeholders" functionality of `TLevel.Load` in a flexible manner (user can decide what to replace with what).

- There will be TCastleSceneView that provides part of the functionality of T3DResource (multiple TCastleSceneView share a single TCastleScene but can show different animation frame of it), but without some often-unnecessary "baggage" from T3DResource (like refcounting of T3DResource, and it's special Prepare/Release methods).

- It should be possible to add an A.I. (like TWalkAttackLogic) to any TCastleTransform instance.

I know I want to go in this direction. Based on the questions (including on Discord) I see that the API of these 5 units is not clear to people. It wraps TCastleScene / TCastleViewport / TCastleNavigation, but in ways that are not obvious, and that is something I want to improve.

Again, bear in mind that it will not happen any time soon :) You can safely and happily use these units, probably for a few years to come.

But it is something I think about for the future, and it may explain some of my decisions. E.g. that is why I don't plan special integration of TCastleCreature with castle-editor. Instead I want to enable you to add future TWalkAttackLogic to any TCastleTransform one day. And thus we will have "easy creatures" in CGE but with more flexible API.

## Bridge TDrawableImage with TCastleScene, enable drawing UI into TCastleScene, to have UI rotated in 3D with perspective.

link:how_to_render_2d[See also here.]

## MDL and/or MaterialX integration

- MDL, https://developer.nvidia.com/rendering-technologies/mdl-sdk

- MaterialX, https://materialx.org/

We can make 3D modeling of realistically-looking stuff much easier by reusing libraries of realistic materials.

## USD – Universal Scene Description support

Explore possibility to support https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/index.html[USD – Universal Scene Description] format as a first-class citizen, alongside glTF and X3D, in CGE.

## Integration with Nakama (scalable server for social and real-time games and apps)

https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama

https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/getting-started/index.html

Nakama is an open-source server (which you can extend) and client API (which you can use from various game engines -- see https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/client-libraries/ ) to get easy networking capabilities. You can host the server yourself or pay to get ready hosting.

I think this, combined with CGE API, may give us networking capabilities comparable with some popular solutions known from other game engines.

## Project settings editable using GUI

We will expose both current `CastleEngineManifest.xml` and `data/CastleSettings.xml` as something you can edit yourself with GUI.

But we *don't want* to create and maintain a custom GUI for them, instead the plan is to:

* Create Pascal components with published properties representing their data.
* Make the project settings files just "JSON design files" for the editor.

So you'll have a file like `project.castle-project` and using editor menu item like _"Project Build Settings"_ will really just open a design `project.castle-project` (JSON) in the editor, and it will be just a serialized `TCastleProject` component. Same for _"Project Runtime Settings"_ which edits `data/settings.castle-project-settings`.

Bonus: we'll associate `*.castle-project` with the system, to open when you double-click it e.g. from Windows installer.

Bonus: you can add non-visual components to `data/settings.castle-project-settings` and load them using `Container.DesignedComponent('xxx')`. This is great e.g. to add sounds or fonts or other data that you want to later load in CGE, from any view.

There are a few details that have to be ironed out here:

* how should the new equivalent of `CastleEngineManifest.xml` and `data/CastleSettings.xml` interact. We will likely keep 2 files, `project.castle-project` and `data/settings.castle-project-settings`, as
+
--
- Some information doesn't need to be packed into data, part of it could even be considered "somewhat secret" (e.g. SDK IDs for Android analytics should *not* be present anywhere in the non-Android builds).
- Some information should be packed into data automatically, by default, everything. To enable that _Bonus: you can add non-visual components_ feature.
--

* most intuitive names for all the things above (menu item names, component names, extensions etc.) :)
