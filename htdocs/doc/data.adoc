:cge-social-share-image: castle_model_viewer_flying_cthulhu.png

== Introduction

The `data` subdirectory of a _Castle Game Engine_ project is special. This is where you should put all the files that your application will load during runtime. This includes _designs_ (usually created using link:editor[]), 3D models, images, sounds, and any other data files that you need.

Load these files using a special URL protocol `castle-data:/...`.

// Loading from
// `castle-data:/images/my_image.png` is equivalent to loading from
// deprecated `ApplicationData('images/my_image.png')`.
// We advise to use only `castle-data:/xxx`.
// We like such URLs as they can be saved to files easily (since they are just
// String) so can be saved to CGE editor designs, X3D models with URLs etc.
// And using castle-data:/ everywhere is more consistent than having a mix
// of castle-data:/ and ApplicationData usage.

== Features

- This directory is automatically correctly packaged by the link:build_tool[build tool] and link:editor[]. E.g. it will be correctly added to the Android `apk` file, iOS or Nintendo Switch application.

- It is detected in a smart way. E.g. it allows to place your data files in a system-wide location on Unix. The details are below.

- The detection can be customized using the cgeref:ApplicationDataOverride[] global variable. Though we recommend to not touch it -- the default algorithm was designed to account for a lot of normal use-cases and has been adjusted to account for specifics of every platform.

NOTE: You are not limited at runtime to reading only files from this `data` directory, of course. You can read any file on disk (using regular filenames or `file:/...` URLs) at runtime. See link:url[URLs docs].

== Example things to put in the `data` subdirectory

- Designs made by link:editor[]. A typical link:views[view] has this in constructor:
+
[source,pascal]
----
constructor TViewMain.Create(AOwner: TComponent);
begin
  inherited;
  DesignUrl := 'castle-data:/gameviewmain.castle-user-interface';
end;
----

- Game 3D and 2D models, loaded e.g. by
+
[source,pascal]
----
MyScene.Load('castle-data:/my_model.x3d');
----
+
See link:viewport_and_scenes[loading 3D and 2D models in viewports].

- 2D images, loaded e.g. by
+
[source,pascal]
----
MyImageControl.Url := 'castle-data:/my_image.png';
----
+
See link:using_images[displaying images].

- Sounds, loaded e.g. by
+
[source,pascal]
----
MySound.Url := 'castle-data:/my_sound.wav';
----
+
See link:sound[loading sounds].

- ... and really anything else you plan to load during the game. Your custom files can be loaded using
+
[source,pascal]
----
MyStream := Download('castle-data:/my_binary_file');
----
+
or
+
[source,pascal]
----
MyTextReader := TCastleTextReader.Create('castle-data:/my_text_file.txt');
----
+
See link:url[loading from URLs].

== Data should be considered read-only

The resources accessed using the `castle-data:/` should be treated as *read-only*. That is, do not attempt to modify them.

While _sometimes_ you can actually modify them (in particular, they are just regular files, owned by the current user, when you distribute your application as a simple `.zip` on Windows or Linux) but for portability we advise to treat them as read-only. This means that your application will continue to work on Android, iOS, or when users install it "system-wide" on desktops e.g. to `c:/program files.../` on Windows. In all these scenarios, the `castle-data:/` resources will be strictly read-only.

=== Use `castle-config:/` instead to write stuff

If you need to _write_ some data, use the `castle-config:/` protocol to access space for writing resources (config files, savegames, user projects...).

See link:url#castle-config[castle-config:/ URLs] for more information about this.

== Advanced: How do we determine the data directory?

The algorithm to find base data directory is OS-specific. It searches a couple of common locations, using the first location that exists. We look inside standard user-specific directories, then inside standard system-wide directories, then we look for the `data` subdirectory in the current exe directory (under Windows) or in the current working directory (under other OSes).

WARNING: *The algorithm below is complicated. Don't read this!* Instead follow the short explanation: just place the files inside the `data` subdirectory of your project, and everything will work out-of-the-box.

The details how we currently choose the data directory:

Windows::
- `data` subdirectory inside our exe directory, if exists.
- `../../data` relative to our exe location, if it exists and exe seems to be inside a subdirectory `<platform>/<config>/`.
+
Where `<platform>` matches current Delphi `<platform>` name (like `Win32` or `Win64` -- this is combined OS and CPU) and `<config>` matches `Debug` or `Release`. This is deliberately adjusted to _Delphi / {Cpp} Builder_ default project settings, so that we detect `data` automatically when exe location follows Delphi conventions. This deliberately checks whether subdirectory names match `<platform>/<config>/`, to avoid picking up a random `data` subdirectory for unrelated project.
- Otherwise: just our exe directory.
+
WARNING: Don't depend on this "last resort" fallback in your applications. Instead, place the data inside the `data` subdirectory.

macOS::
- `Contents/Resources/data` subdirectory inside our bundle directory, if we are inside a bundle and such subdirectory exists.
- Otherwise, fallback on generic Unix detection, see below.

iOS::
- `data` subdirectory inside our bundle directory, if we are inside a bundle and such subdirectory exists.
- Otherwise, fallback on generic Unix detection, see below.

Android::
- Always use Android _assets_ packaged in APK. This is a special location on Android where application should store it's assets.

Nintendo Switch::
- Always use special location on Nintendo Switch where application should store it's data.

Unix (Linux, FreeBSD, macOS...)::
- `~/.local/share/<ApplicationName>`.
+
This is user-specific data directory, following the default dictated by https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/basedir-spec/[basedir spec]. If such directory exists, it is returned.
+
This is checked first, to allow user to always override system-wide installation of a program with his/her own installation. E.g. consider the situation when an old version of a program is installed system-wide in `/usr/local/share/my_program/` , but some user (with no access to root account) wants to install a newer version of it for himself. This is possible, because `~/.local/share/my_program/` is checked before `/usr/local/share/my_program/`.
- `/usr/local/share/<ApplicationName>`. If such directory exists, it is returned.
+
This is for system-wide installations without package manager.
- `/usr/share/<ApplicationName>`. If such directory exists, it is returned.
+
This is for system-wide installations with package manager.
- `data` subdirectory of the current directory, if exists.
+
This is easiest and comfortable for development, just keep the `data` subdirectory alongside the executable binary.
+
This is searched *after* system-wide specific dirs above, to avoid accidentally picking unrelated `data` in current directory instead of system-wide data.
- Otherwise: As a last resort, we just return the current directory.
+
WARNING: Don't depend on this "last resort" fallback in your applications. Instead, place the data inside the `data` subdirectory.
