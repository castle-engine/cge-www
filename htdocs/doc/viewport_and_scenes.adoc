## Viewport and scenes

### Overview

The most important _Castle Game Engine_ class to display 3D and 2D models is cgeref:TCastleScene[]. You simply set the cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.URL[TCastleScene.URL] property to load a model, like link:glTF[gltf] or link:sprite_sheets[sprite sheet] file.

You have to insert instances of scenes into a viewport (more precisely, cgeref:TCastleViewport.Items[] tree) to make them actually visible. cgeref:TCastleViewport[] represents a 2D viewport on a screen, within this viewport your world (3D or 2D) is displayed. Viewport is a _user interface_ control, which means that it descends from cgeref:TCastleUserInterface[] and it shares the same feature we've seen in the link:view_events[previous chapter about views and UI].


The scenes can be transformed (moved, rotated, scaled) within the viewport. You can arrange them in transformation groups using cgeref:TCastleTransform[]. cgeref:TCastleTransform[] is an ancestor of cgeref:TCastleScene[] that doesn't display anything by itself, but it transforms all the children.

### Video

If you like to learn by watching, this is good introduction to viewport capabilities in 3D and 2D:

### TCastleTransform descendants

cgeref:TCastleViewport[] has a property cgeref:TCastleViewport.Items[] that holds everything that the viewport displays.

You can add there any classes descending from cgeref:TCastleTransform[]. We list the most important classes and their properties below.

#### Transform (TCastleTransform)

Use the base cgeref:TCastleTransform[] class to transform and group the children.

The most important properties are cgeref:TCastleTransform.Translation[Translation], cgeref:TCastleTransform.Rotation[Rotation], cgeref:TCastleTransform.Scale[Scale]. Operate on children using methods like cgeref:TCastleTransform.Add[Add], cgeref:TCastleTransform.Remove[Remove].

#### Scene (TCastleScene)

cgeref:TCastleScene[] is the most important class to display 3D and 2D models.

It can render, animate, perform collisions etc. Set cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.URL[URL] to load the model. Run animation using cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.PlayAnimation[PlayAnimation]. cgeref:TCastleScene[] descends from cgeref:TCastleTransform[]. So you can also use cgeref:TCastleTransform.Translation[Translation], cgeref:TCastleTransform.Rotation[Rotation], cgeref:TCastleTransform.Scale[Scale] to transform it. Scene can even have children. Use cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.ExposeTransforms[ExposeTransforms] to attach children to animated bones in glTF skeleton.

#### Text (TCastleText)

cgeref:TCastleText[] allows to display a text, possibly transformed in 3D.

Its most important property is cgeref:TCastleText.Caption[] (or, if you want access the multi-line string list, cgeref:TCastleText.Text[]). The font is configurable using cgeref:TCastleText.CustomFont[].
//In many ways, the cgeref:TCastleText[] is an analogy to cgeref:TCastleLabel[]. Use cgeref:TCastleLabel[] for user interface,

[NOTE]
====
Use cgeref:TCastleText[] when the text is part of the game world (it moves when the camera moves) and when the text may be in 3D.

For user interface text, outside of viewport, use cgeref:TCastleLabel[] instead. cgeref:TCastleLabel[] and cgeref:TCastleText[] are similar in many ways, they share some properties like `Caption` and `CustomFont`.

#### Primitives (TCastlePlane, TCastleBox, TCastleSphere, TCastleCylinder, TCastleCone)

cgeref:TCastlePlane[], cgeref:TCastleBox[], cgeref:TCastleSphere[], cgeref:TCastleCylinder[], cgeref:TCastleCone[] are easy 3D primitives that you can use to design your world.

All of them have a configurable size, cgeref:TCastleAbstractPrimitive.Material[Material] (set to `pmPhong` or `pmUnlit` to easily make it brighter), cgeref:TCastleAbstractPrimitive.Color[Color], cgeref:TCastleAbstractPrimitive.Texture[Texture] and other basics. While you could create such simple objects in any 3D authoring software (and use them through cgeref:TCastleScene[] as well), our primitives are often very useful for quickly prototyping your game world.

#### Image (TCastleImageTransform)

cgeref:TCastleImageTransform[] allows to display an image inside a viewport. This is great for simple static 2D game backgrounds, that should move along with player or camera. The image has a configurable pivot, it can be repeated and resized in an easy way.

Set cgeref:TCastleImageTransform.Url[Url] to load the image. Optionally adjust cgeref:TCastleImageTransform.RepeatImage[RepeatImage], cgeref:TCastleImageTransform.Size[Size], cgeref:TCastleImageTransform.Pivot[Pivot] as you see fit.

#### Reference (TCastleTransformReference)

cgeref:TCastleTransformReference[] makes a reference to another cgeref:TCastleTransform[] (e.g. a single scene, or a group of scenes) to instantiate it again within the same viewport. This is an efficient way to create *a lot* of instances of the same object. At the end of link:viewport_3d[Tutorial: Designing a 3D world] we have a quick section describing how to use it.

Set cgeref:TCastleTransformReference.Reference[] to indicate which transformation is referenced by this instance.

## Camera

link:camera[Camera] determines what part of the world (3D or 2D) is visible in the viewport. Ready camera instance is available as cgeref:TCastleViewport.Camera[] property. You can configure camera easily by changing its properties e.g. cgeref:TCastleTransform.Translation[MyViewport.Camera.Translation := Vector3(1, 2, 3)].

## Navigation

link:navigation[Navigation] is our term to describe a class handling user input to move the camera. Our engine provides some ready navigation classes, for example cgeref:TCastleWalkNavigation[] implementing a typical navigation in FPS games. But you don't have to use our ready navigation classes, you can easily just move the camera with your own code.

## Next: Using the viewport in Castle Game Engine editor

Now that you know the basic terminology and classes, let's see how to actually use them.

Next chapters will start by describing how to use them in our _visual editor_, and later we'll show examples how to use them from Pascal. Remember that everything you do inside the editor can be done by Pascal code too. In particular, all the classes and their properties that you use within the editor are really the same classes you use from Pascal code. So whatever you can change from editor -- you can also later change during the game, from code. And all the class instances that you create within the editor (like cgeref:TCastleScene[]) -- can also be created (or destroyed) in any order during the game execution.
