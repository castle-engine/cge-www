Delayed for now,
we had a page on Wikipedia but it was deleted due to low notability,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Castle_Game_Engine .
I accept this -- we need to be a more popular engine before retrying it.

* Create a page on http://en.wikipedia.org/[Wikipedia] about our
  link:index.php[Castle Game Engine] and / or
  link:castle-model-viewer[Castle Model Viewer].
  <!--
  Or maybe only about the engine, and just redirect castle-model-viewer there?
  I don't want to create and add it myself, it would not be fair.
  So this task waits for willing user (you! :) to do it.
  Of course you will get help (you can ask, post your draft etc.
  on our forum and such).

* Spread the word! Mention the engine in your company, in your online community, talk about our engine on blogs, social platforms.

== If you create games

* First of all, just *use our engine to make your next fantastic game!* And publish it everywhere you can (your website, Steam, Itch.io, Google Play, App Store, Nintendo Switch store...).

* Show your game on our https://forum.castle-engine.io/[forum] or link:talk.php[Discord]. Share a screenshot, movie recording, a build, code -- anything you can/want to share.

* Give us feedback about the engine: what works good, what could be improved, what do you miss. Let's talk on https://forum.castle-engine.io/[forum] or link:talk.php[Discord].

* Report any bug to https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/issues[our issues tracker].

* Improve our documentation. It's easiest to improve the pages maintained in AsciiDoctor format, just edit the `.adoc` files in the https://github.com/castle-engine/cge-www/tree/master/htdocs/doc[htdocs/doc subdirectory of the cge-www repository].

* Contribute code, send pull requests.

If you're looking for a feature / fix to implement, it's usually best to just start with _"what is your itch"_, that is: address a problem (bug or missing feature) that you have in your game. If you're open to help with anything we need, link:roadmap[take a look at our roadmap] or just link:talk.php[ask us] for what's currently needed.

See link:coding_conventions[coding conventions] on how to contribute code.

== If you are a package maintainer

Package link:index.php[Castle Game Engine] and link:castle-model-viewer[Castle Model Viewer] for your favorite Linux distribution.

* link:castle-model-viewer[Castle Model Viewer] is a versatile viewer for link:creating_data_model_formats.php[many model formats].

* Castle Game Engine is an open-source 3D and 2D cross-platform game engine, with a comfortable editor and a powerful API using modern Object Pascal. link:features[All features are listed here].

* Desktop integration files (SVG icons, .desktop files etc.) are already included in our archives.

* Build-dependencies include http://www.freepascal.org/[Free Pascal Compiler], but this should not be a problem -- all major Linux distros already have FPC packaged.
