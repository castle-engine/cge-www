_Darkest Before the Dawn_ is a tiny game developed by Michalis Kamburelis during the http://tensquaregames.com/[TenSquareGames] gamejam on 23-24th of November 2013. It is the first game made using link:index.php[Castle Game Engine] specifically for Android (although it can be compiled as a normal, standalone game for Linux, Windows etc. too).

////
The game is available as an .apk file for Android.
On your Android device, make sure to enable installation of applications
from _Unknown sources_ (in _Settings -> Security_,
http://developer.android.com/distribute/open.html#unknown-sources[like shown here]).
Then just download the apk file, and Android should
automatically propose to install it.
