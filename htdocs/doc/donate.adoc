*We are making* an link:features[open-source game engine, 3D and 2D, with comfortable visual editor and a powerful API]. We proudly cooperate with open standards (link:x3d[X3D], link:gltf[glTF], link:ifc[IFC]). We like link:why_pascal[modern Pascal], https://castle-engine.io/manual_automatic_builds.php[continuous integration], being cross-platform (desktop, mobile, consoles, link:web[web]). We're passionate about _open-source and free software_ and tools to design _engaging stories_ in the form of computer games.

*The primary goal of your donations* is to give us time to spend on the engine development. More time translates to link:roadmap[more features], faster. By 2024, _Michalis Kamburelis_, the lead engine developer, spent most of his life on the engine and doesn't plan to stop :) Moreover, since May 2024, Michalis works on the engine full-time counting only on your support. So anything you can give is really appreciated!

_The secondary goal of donations_ is to cover "service" costs. This includes cost of domains, own servers (link:https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7133327[Vultr]), mail (and other link:https://proton.me/[Proton] services) for `xxx@castle-engine.io` accounts, https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=7891434499544220905[Google Play], Steam app, Apple membership (link:castle-model-viewer-mobile[Castle Model Viewer Mobile] on iOS), accounting and other costs.
//If we get enough donations, we hope to also cover _Apple membership_ to release link:castle-model-viewer-mobile[Castle Model Viewer Mobile] for link:ios[iOS] and sign our link:macos[macOS] releases.
