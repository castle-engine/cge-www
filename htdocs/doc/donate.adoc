*We are making* an link:features[open-source game engine, 3D and 2D, with comfortable visual editor and a powerful API]. We proudly cooperate with open standards (link:x3d[X3D], link:gltf[glTF]). We like link:why_pascal[modern Pascal], https://castle-engine.io/manual_automatic_builds.php[continuous integration], being cross-platform (desktop, mobile, consoles, link:roadmap#web[soon web]). We're passionate about _open-source and free software_ and tools to design _engaging stories_ in the form of computer games.

*The primary goal of your donations* is to give us time to spend on the engine development. More time translates to link:roadmap[more features], faster. By 2024, _Michalis Kamburelis_, the lead engine developer, spent most of his life on the engine and doesn't plan to stop :) Moreover, since May 2024, Michalis works on the engine full-time counting only on your support. So anything you can give is really appreciated!

=== Open Collective

Another option is to https://opencollective.com/castle-engine[support us on Open Collective].

Then you can pay for this work, and get a formal invoice for your company, through https://opencollective.com/opensource[Open Source Collective]. The gist of it is that _Castle Game Engine_ can formally act as a (US-based) company, in particular we can issue invoices for your accounting and tax needs.
