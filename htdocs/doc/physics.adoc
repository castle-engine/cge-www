:description: Using physics to handle collisions between rigid bodies.
:cge-social-share-image: physics_1.png

== Introduction

Physics allows you to define _rigid bodies_ that can

- _collide_ with each other (following the designated _collider_ geometry)
- are affected by _forces_ (like _gravity_ and custom forces you apply)
- are connected by _joints_.

The physics collisions automatically result in a proper response, i.e. objects "bounce off" each other when they collide.

To achieve all this, _Castle Game Engine_ is integrated with https://github.com/BeRo1985/kraft[Kraft Physics Engine] made by _Benjamin 'BeRo' Rosseaux_. Read on to learn how to add physics to your own games.

== Rigid Bodies and Colliders

cgeimg::block[platformer_physics_components.png|Physics Components]

Use these components (available in both editor and code) to control the physics.

- cgeref:TCastleRigidBody[] : This component activates processing the transformation by physics.

- _Colliders_ are components descending from abstract cgeref:TCastleCollider[]:
+
--
- cgeref:TCastleSphereCollider[]
- cgeref:TCastleBoxCollider[]
- cgeref:TCastleCapsuleCollider[]
- cgeref:TCastlePlaneCollider[] (using this collider forces the body to be static)
- cgeref:TCastleMeshCollider[] (using this collider forces the body to be static)
+
A _mesh_ that collides (referenced by cgeref:TCastleMeshCollider.Mesh[]) can be cgeref:TCastleScene[], cgeref:TCastleTerrain[], or any primitive descending from cgeref:TCastleAbstractPrimitive[].
--

To make any cgeref:TCastleTransform[] affected by physics add there a collider (any cgeref:TCastleCollider[] descendant) and a rigid body (cgeref:TCastleRigidBody[]).

In the editor, adding any collider automatically also adds the cgeref:TCastleRigidBody[], so you only need to do one step: add a collider. The usual way to do this is by right-clicking on a cgeref:TCastleTransform[] instance in your hierarchy, and choosing from context menu _"Add Behavior -> Physics -> Collider -> ..."_.

NOTE: Adding a collider from `2D` group will automatically also add cgeref:TCastleRigidBody[] configured in an optimal way for 2D (using cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.Setup2D[]).

Then run _"Physics -> Play Simulation"_ (use the menu item or button on the header) and observe that body is affected by

- gravity
- collisions with other objects.

Note that various components descend from cgeref:TCastleTransform[] and thus can act as physics bodies: cgeref:TCastleScene[], primitives like cgeref:TCastleBox[], cgeref:TCastleSphere[], even terrains cgeref:TCastleTerrain[].

There are lots of options to tweak how things behave. See API docs for documentation.

You can visualize physics colliders (esp. useful if you disable the cgeref:TCastleCollider.AutoSize[] on them and want to see the effect) using the menu item _"Physics -> Show Colliders"_.

The colliders in general should not collide at start. You should set up the colliders to avoid it. To make the collider smaller than automatically calculated you can:

- disable the cgeref:TCastleCollider.AutoSize[] and setup all collider sizes manually,

- or set cgeref:TCastleCollider.SizeScale[] to value like `0.9`, to make the size (auto-detected or not) smaller by 90%.

[NOTE]
====
A good test to enjoy the physics is to make a "bullet" that will hit some rigid body with significant speed, so that you can see how it behaves on collision. To make a bullet, just

- add some collider to the object you want to act as a bullet (this will also add cgeref:TCastleRigidBody[] to it)
- set cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.LinearVelocity[] to something non-zero.

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VPL2awHsMA[quick demo movie].

=== Adding physics components using code

As with all CGE components, while you can add them by clicking in CGE editor (at design-time), you can also add them using Pascal code at run-time. Like this:

[source,pascal]
----
var
  NewBody: TCastleRigidBody;
  NewCollider: TCastleSphereCollider;
begin;
  NewBody := TCastleRigidBody.Create(FreeAtStop);
  //NewBody.Setup2D;
  MyTransform.AddBehavior(NewBody);

  NewCollider := TCastleSphereCollider.Create(FreeAtStop);
  NewCollider.Restitution := 0.6;
  NewCollider.Mass := 1;
  MyTransform.AddBehavior(NewCollider);
end;
----

== Physics Simulation in the Editor

You can start a _"Physics Simulation"_ right in the editor. This is a great way to test how physics behaves without the need to actually run the game.

During the simulation you *can* click around and modify the design even while the physics is runnning. Beware: _the design will be restored to the original state when physics stops_. If you want to really modify the design (not only make a temporary experiment), you should first _stop the physics simulation_.

NOTE: In the editor we only run the physics simulation, not your final game code. That said, various components may adapt to the "simulation" to behave in editor just as they do at run-time. Your link:custom_components[custom components] can adapt to simulation too, just honor the current cgeref:CastleApplicationMode[] value.

== 2D Games

cgeimg::block[
  physics_2d.png|Physics 2D,
  physics_asteroids.png|Physics Asteroids demo
]

The whole physics can work for 2D games as well as 3D. For 2D, remember to:

- Adjust cgeref:TCastleRigidBody[] by locking rotation/translation (such that the object stays within the same XY plane). It's easiest to do this by calling cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.Setup2D[] from code.
+
In CGE editor, just add _"Physics -> Rigid Body (2D)"_ component. Actually it will be added automatically if you add _"Physics -> Collider 2D -> ..."_.

- Set cgeref:TCastleCollider.Mode2D[] to `true` (to auto-size and to account for scale in a way better for 2D). In CGE editor, just add the _"Physics -> Collider 2D -> ..."_ components.

We feature a number of 2D physics demos in our examples on https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/physics/[examples/physics], check them out.

== Forces (Pushing, Rotating Bodies)

You can apply forces from code. This can be used to simulate forces other than gravity. For example: wind or explosion.

See demos:

- https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/physics/physics_forces[examples/physics/physics_forces] - test various methods to apply forces.

- https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/physics/physics_explosion[examples/physics/physics_explosion] - test explosion.

To apply the force use on of these methods:

- cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.AddForceAtPosition[] - push objects in the given direction, with given strength, from the given position.

- cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.AddForce[] - push objects in the given direction, with given strength. The direction may be in local or global coordinate system.

- cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.AddTorque[] - rotate the objects using physics.

- cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.ApplyImpulse[] - apply an instant impulse. This is more instant way of affecting the velocity than the `AddXxx` methods above.

Here's how an explosion can look like:

=== Transforming various objects

Instead of using forces, you *can* also just change the position/rotation of the object affected by physics, e.g. by directly changing cgeref:TCastleTransform.Translation[].

Whether this is a good idea, depends on the object type:

- _Dynamic_ objects: If the object has cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.Dynamic[] = `true` (cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.Animated[] is ignored in this case), it means physics simulation moves and rotates this object.
+
We allow you to change the object, e.g. by explicitly changing cgeref:TCastleTransform.Translation[], but you should refrain from doing it often. As you effectively override physics calculations, forcing the physics engine also to reposition your object in various internal structures.

- _Kinematic_ objects: If the object has cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.Dynamic[] = `false` and cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.Animated[] = `true`, you are welcome to transform this object. Physics engine is prepared for it.

- _Static_ objects: If the object has cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.Dynamic[] = `false` and cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.Animated[] = `false`, you *can* change the object transformation, but you should refrain from doing so.
+
Physics engine may optimize static objects. You make this optimization counter-productive (the physics engine will have to reposition your object in various internal structures) if you change the transformation of static object often.

== Ray-casting (Querying For Collision)

Use the cgeref:TCastleAbstractRootTransform.PhysicsRayCast[] to cast a ray and see whether it hits something. It takes and returns values (ray origin, direction, returned distance, point) in the world coordinate system.

Alternatively use the cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.PhysicsRayCast[] which is similar, but takes parameters in the coordinate system of the parent cgeref:TCastleTransform[].

== Detecting Collisions

You can detect whether a collision has occurred by

- Assigning a callback to events cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.OnCollisionEnter[], cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.OnCollisionStay[], cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.OnCollisionExit[].

- Or checking (e.g. in each link:view_events[view Update event]) the value of cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.GetCollidingTransforms[].

See the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/physics/physics_2d_collisions[examples/physics/physics_2d_collisions] for a demo.

== Joints

_Joints_ allow to connect one physics body to another in some way that limits their ability to move/rotate relative to each other.

For example a _hinge joint_ forces one physics body to only be rotated relative to another along a given axis. Like a door that is attached to a wall using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinge[hinges] and can only rotate in a constrained way.

Hitting a physics body with something (like another physics body or using the forces API) will respect the joints.

Joints can be made _breakable_ which means they can be broken if sufficiently big force is used.

Joints are simply components in Pascal that are derived from cgeref:TCastleBehavior[] and can be attached to any cgeref:TCastleTransform[].

- You can add them from CGE editor using the _"Add Behavior -> Physics -> Joints -> ..."_ menu item.
- Each joint component has a number of properties to control its behavior.
- Often joints have some _anchors_ that can be manipulated visually if you right-click on the joint component in the hierarchy and do _"Show Joint Tools"_.

NOTE: Joints only make sense for cgeref:TCastleTransform[] that are affected by physics. So you most often need add cgeref:TCastleRigidBody[] and some cgeref:TCastleCollider[] descendant to the same cgeref:TCastleTransform[] that has a joint.

Here's a demo:

video::apCQXr9PBhs[youtube,width=800,height=450]

== Layers

By default, all physics bodies are on the same, default layer (with index 0) and can collide with each other.

You can place bodies on different layers, like _"ground"_, _"enemies"_, _"bullets"_ and so on. You can then configure which layer collides with which. You have 20 layers available.

There are really just 2 things to configure:

1. At each rigid body, set the cgeref:TCastleRigidBody.Layer[] to indicate the layer on which the body is.
+
To help with this, you can add names and even longer descriptions to layers. Do this through cgeref:TPhysicsProperties.LayerNames[Viewport.Items.PhysicsProperties.LayerNames]. In the usual workflow, just click to configure `LayerNames` using "..." button in the editor. The names and descriptions are only for the developer, to better document the layer meaning.
+
cgeimg::block[physics_platformer_layer.png|Physics layer combo box in platformer game]

2. Configure which layer collides with which using the checkboxes at cgeref:TPhysicsProperties.LayerCollisions[Viewport.Items.PhysicsProperties.LayerCollisions]. You can set them from code, or click on "..." from CGE editor to configure them visually.

More involved example is in https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/platformer[examples/platformer].

== Examples of physics

We have a lot of examples dedicated to physics in the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/physics[examples/physics] subdirectory. Go ahead and check them out!

== Future plans (TODOs)

Current physics engine integration is just a start. The plans are:

- Make cgeref:TCastleWalkNavigation[] use physics to move (just like cgeref:TCastleThirdPersonNavigation[] already can).
+
_In progress_ already (by Andrzej Kilijański).

- _(See section below about "Old system")_ Currently we also have an older, simpler, internal physics/collision engine in CGE, that takes care of some tasks: the collisions of player and creatures (from CastleCreatures), a simple gravity for them, and custom collision methods for you (like RayCollision, SphereCollision etc. in CastleTransform unit). The new physics engine should eventually replace them all, and there should be a flag to make it possible, and eventually it should even become the default, and the old collision implementation should be simply removed.

- A shape within the `TCastleScene` should be able to act like a rigid body, independent of the rest of the scene. Our current preferred plan to this is to depend that you will assign rigid bodies and colliders in CGE editor (or by Pascal code) to `TCastleTransform` created by the `ExposeTransforms` feature. And we can just synchronize changes from bones exposed by `ExposeTransforms` back to the original model.
+
This will allow you to attach physics to particular parts (any transformation) of the model.
+
We are close to realizing this goal, except that `ExposeTransforms` do not (yet) synchronize _back_ their changes to the parent model.

- Integration with other physics engines, through a layer providing a common API.
+
We consider these 2 candidates for proving an (alternative) physics engine now:
+
--
1. http://bulletphysics.org/[Bullet]. Very full-featured, e.g. there's soft body, not only rigid body.
+
Full integration with Bullet will require proper translation of Bullet API to C and then to Pascal (as Bullet is in C++, it's not readily usable from anything other than C++). There is a C header for Bullet, see https://code.google.com/archive/p/bullet/issues/43[this old Google Code issue] and https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/issues/130[this GitHub issue], but it's rather minimalistic (only rigid body), although it may be a good start.

2. https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk[PhysX] from Nvidia. Open-source, multi-platform, lots of features.

== Old system for collisions and gravity

In parallel to resolving collisions using physics engine (that honors the `TCastleRigidBody` and `TCastleXxxCollider` behaviors), for some purposes _Castle Game Engine_ can also use an older _"simple physics"_ implementation.

This _"simple physics"_ implementation is fully implemented in CGE, without using Kraft or any other "full-blown" physics engine. Capabilities:

- It can resolve collisions with (potentially dynamic) meshes using octrees, constructed for each cgeref:TCastleScene[] or each shape of such scene.

- Can perform simple (non-realistic) gravity.

It is used (for now) by:

- FPS walk/fly navigation in cgeref:TCastleWalkNavigation[].

- API to query for collisions in world-space coordinates using `Viewport.Items.WorldXxx` methods, like
+
--
- cgeref:TCastleAbstractRootTransform.WorldMoveAllowed[Viewport.Items.WorldMoveAllowed],
- cgeref:TCastleAbstractRootTransform.WorldHeight[Viewport.Items.WorldHeight],
- cgeref:TCastleAbstractRootTransform.WorldLineOfSight[Viewport.Items.WorldLineOfSight],
- cgeref:TCastleAbstractRootTransform.WorldRayCast[Viewport.Items.WorldRayCast],
- cgeref:TCastleAbstractRootTransform.WorldBoxCollision[Viewport.Items.WorldBoxCollision],
- cgeref:TCastleAbstractRootTransform.WorldSphereCollision[Viewport.Items.WorldSphereCollision].
--

- API to query for collisions in coordinates of particular transform parent using cgeref:TCastleViewport[] methods, like:
+
--
- cgeref:TCastleTransform.MoveAllowed[],
- cgeref:TCastleTransform.Height[],
- cgeref:TCastleTransform.LineOfSight[],
- cgeref:TCastleTransform.RayCast[],
- cgeref:TCastleTransform.BoxCollision[],
- cgeref:TCastleTransform.SphereCollision[].
--

The long-term goal is to completely remove this _"simple physics"_ implementation in CGE. All it's functions can be, or will be, possible to achieve using _"real physics engine"_ (like Kraft). But for the time being, some functions are still realized using this _"simple physics"_. The relevant properties are:

- cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.PreciseCollisions[]:
+
--
- `false` indicates that scene collides as its bounding box.
- `true` indicates that we build and update a collision structure (octree) reflecting precisely the triangles in the scene. So the scene collides as a precise set of triangles.
--
+
This value matters also at design-time (in CGE editor). For larger scenes (like levels), it is necessary to set cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.PreciseCollisions[] to `true`, otherwise picking smaller scenes (like creatures inside a level) will be impossible, because the big level scene will collide as a big box that includes everything.
+
Underneath, these is a deprecated property cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.Spatial[] with a bit more options. But we advise to only use cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.PreciseCollisions[] to toggle between the 2 above useful values.

- cgeref:TCastleTransform.Collides[]. By default this is `true`. When it is `false`, the transfomation object (and all its children) does not collide at all.
+
This affects all collision routines *except* `RayCollision` and `RayCast` that look at cgeref:TCastleTransform.Pickable[].

- cgeref:TCastleTransform.Pickable[]. By default this is `true`. When it is `false`, the transfomation object (and all its children) does not affect the results of ray collision (`RayCollision` and `RayCast`).

- Note: when both cgeref:TCastleTransform.Collides[] and cgeref:TCastleTransform.Pickable[] are `false`, then cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.Spatial[] and cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.PreciseCollisions[] don't matter. In such case, the object will not collide ever (neither as bounding box, nor as a precise mesh).

- cgeref:TCastleTransform.Gravity[]. When `true`, the relevant object falls down according to (non-realistic) gravity. It will honor (be stopped by) other objects that have `Collides` = `true`.

- cgeref:TCastleWalkNavigation.Gravity[]. When `true`, the player avatar falls down according to (non-realistic) gravity. It will honor (be stopped by) other objects that have `Collides` = `true`.

In the long-term, all these properties/methods will be

* deprecated (and later removed)

* or they will switch to using physics. They will honor whatever colliders you configure using the `TCastleRigidBody` and `TCastleXxxCollider` behaviors, and nothing more. And they will honor physics layers (coming soon).

So all collisions and all gravity should be done using physics engine.
