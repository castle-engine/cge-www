# Web Target

:description: Upcoming support for web development in CGE.
:cge-social-share-image: web_1_vivaldi.png

== Introduction

[WARNING]
====
This feature is in development now. We can already build and run a CGE application in the browser but it's not yet our real rendering -- WebAssembly code only renders an unimpressive yellow rectangle. Stay tuned!
====

The goal of the _web target_ in _Castle Game Engine_ is to allow you to recompile more-or-less any application you wrote using _Castle Game Engine_ (using cgeref:TCastleWindow[]) to the web. So you can put your application on a website, as part of a regular HTML webpage, and users can play it instantly, without the need to download / install any native application or browser plugin.

== How it works (or will work)

=== Already working

- We're using FPC https://wiki.freepascal.org/WebAssembly[WebAssembly] target.
+
Huge thank you go to the whole FPC team for making it possible! For general documentation (unrelated to CGE), see https://www.freepascal.org/~michael/articles/fpcwasm1/fpcwasm1.pdf[this article by Michael Van Canneyt].

- To run the _WebAssembly_ in a web browser, there is additional "glue" code, which we also write in Pascal and compile using https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/[Pas2js].
+
The integration between https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/[Pas2js] and _FPC + WebAssembly_ is extremely easy, again thanks to the work of everyone involved!

- For development purposes, we can run a simple webserver on the localhost. link:https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/[Pas2js] features a ready `compileserver`, we just use it.
+
NOTE: https://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/fcl-web[FpWeb] also can instantiate a https://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/fphttpserver[standalone HTTP server] in just a few lines of code. But it seems we don't need even this, `compileserver` is all that we need.

- Our link:build_tool[build tool] takes care of everything. You usually want to execute 2 commands:
+
--
1. `castle-engine compile --target=web  --mode=debug`
+
This command:
+
- generates web-specific files (in `castle-engine-output/web/`),
- compiles the glue code using Pas2js,
- compiles the application code using FPC for WebAssembly.
2. `castle-engine run --target=web`
+
This command:
+
- runs web server (`compileserver`) on `http://localhost:3000/` to serve `castle-engine-output/web/dist/`,
- runs web browser (default web browser on your system, logic using our cgeref:OpenUrl[]) to open `http://localhost:3000/`.
--
+
[NOTE]
====
For some specific applications (like our `tests/`) you can also compile the regular _program_ file (like `xxx_standalone.dpr`, whatever is indicated by `standalone_source` in `CastleEngineManifest.xml`) using FPC + WebAssembly to a `.wasm` file using this command:

```shell
castle-engine compile --os=wasi --cpu=wasm32
```

This is _not_ equivalent to `castle-engine compile --target=web`, which generates and compiles a special _library_ file with WebAssembly (and also generates and compiles the glue code using Pas2js, and generates HTML template).

Compiling the standalone program with `castle-engine compile --os=wasi --cpu=wasm32` only makes sense if application was prepared to be run this way. E.g. it allows to run our testsuite using `wasmtime`.
====

- Our link:editor[] can also build and run for web. Underneath, it just calls the build tool commands described above (which you can see in the _"Console"_).
+
Just change the platform using _"Run -> Platform -> Web"_ menu item and hit _"Build and Run"_ button or menu item (F9).
+
You can also link:#platform_default[set web platform as default].

- We create a HTML file with the `<canvas id="castle-canvas">` element (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas[canvas] docs at MDN). This HTML runs the JS code (compiled by Pas2js) that will in turn run the WASM code of your application, which will initialize and use WebGL context on this canvas.
+
This HTML file can be customized / replaced / rejected as you wish. It only needs to contain a reference to the generated JavaScript file using `<script>` and a `<canvas>` element with ID `castle-canvas`. You can surround it with any content and style.
+
For nice look, our generated HTML also uses https://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap], but again: this can be customized / removed. We don't depend on any special CSS or JS libraries.
+
Some alternative HTML templates may be available in the future, as well as the ability to provide your own template. For now, just https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/webassm_platformer_test/tools/build-tool/data/web/dist/index.html[customize the engine's `tools/build-tool/data/web/dist/index.html`] file.

- We use WebGL API from _WebAssembly_. All our rendering code has been adjusted to WebGL!
+
First step to do this was the https://wiki.freepascal.org/WebAssembly/DOM[JOB] units implemented in Pas2js + FPC. This is a collection of units (on both Pas2js and FPC sides) that cooperate with each other. The goal is to allow our WASM applications to access https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/tip/dom/webidl/WebGLRenderingContext.webidl[WebGL API defined in this WEBIDL file].
+
NOTE: The WebGL API is available in the browser to https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/[Pas2js] (that is, any _JavaScript_ code in the browser). If not for https://wiki.freepascal.org/WebAssembly/DOM[JOB], we would expose this API for the WebAssembly, following the https://www.freepascal.org/~michael/pas2js-demos/wasienv/canvas/[canvas example] described in the 2nd part of https://www.freepascal.org/~michael/articles/fpcwasm1/fpcwasm1.pdf[this article]. But, well, using https://wiki.freepascal.org/WebAssembly/DOM[JOB] makes things even easier.
+
We generate a unit `CastleInternalJobWeb` using this script and WEBIDLs: https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/webassm_platformer_test/src/base_rendering/web/webidl .
+
NOTE: FPC ships an example `job_web.pas` that already contains everything we need, but it's a huge unit. It has 184 thousands of lines and compiling it is slow (this is esp. problematic as current FPC 3.3.1 recompiles everything more often than it should -- it seems that every change even to implementation causes rebuild of everything derived, as if we changed interface). That's why we generate our own unit, `CastleInternalJobWeb` (merely ~16 thousands of lines) that is more focused on what we need: mostly WebGL API.
+
Second step: We then generate include file `castleinternalwebgl_flat_api.inc` that "flattens" the API exposed in `CastleInternalJobWeb`, making it more similar OpenGL ES API in `CastleGLES`. This generation is also looking at WEBIDL, to process all WebGL methods we need. The tool that does this is https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/webassm_platformer_test/tools/internal/generate_webgl_flat_api/generate_webgl_flat_api.dpr[tools/internal/generate_webgl_flat_api].
+
Third step: We then use `CastleInternalWebGL` unit as a drop-in replacement (as much as possible) for `CastleGLES` unit.
+
Lastly, we manually adjusted rendering code to account for final, unavoidable differences between OpenGL ES (`CastleGLES`) and WebGL (`CastleInternalWebGL`). Mostly straightforward work, differences stem mostly from the fact that OpenGL ES is a C API (no as `Variant`, more pointer usage), while WebGL is a JavaScript API (more usage of arrays and, when reasonable, untyped variables like `getParameter`). Just a few `{$ifdef CASTLE_WEBGL}` in strategic places got the job done.
+
In the end, we render using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API[WebGL 1.0], with optional WebGL 2.0 features. This is very similar to current rendering on mobile, where we use https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/03/12/mobile-opengles-rendering-upgrades-occlusion-query-anisotropic-filtering-3d-textures-shadows-plus-new-occlusion-query-demo/[OpenGL ES 2.0, with optional OpenGL ES 3.0 features].

=== Plans (TODOs)

- Handle input (for start: at least mouse down / motion / up).

- For data delivery, we know we'll have to invent a simple format to carry our game data as one big binary blob. The simple plan is to just pack game data into zip.
+
Both FPC and Delphi have built-in support for ZIP handling, we even https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/network/custom_url_handler/code/gameunzip.pas[use it in one example], we'll likely create a more full-featured wrapper that works on both FPC and Delphi.
+
Packing resources into ZIP is beneficial over just placing all data files separately in the webserver directory. It allows to download the ZIP once (at application load) and then our WebAssembly code can load data from it synchronously, thus it can work similarly to how a non-web game data is loaded. Naturally we also want to have cgeref:TCastleDownload[] working and being able to load things asynchronously (see our https://castle-engine.io/manual_network.php[network docs]).
+
TODO: FPC provides some ready file implementation in WASI RTL, it seems. How it works? In browser, in wasmtime?

- For audio, we will add a new sound backend using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API[WebAudio]. This will be the default sound backend on the web (like the https://castle-engine.io/openal[OpenAL] is now the default backend on non-web platforms).
+
It is also possible our https://castle-engine.io/fmod[FMOD] sound backend will also be ported to web, as https://www.fmod.com/docs/2.02/api/platforms-html5.html[FMOD supports HTML5]. This would make FMOD a truly cross-platform sound backend, working on every platform we support in CGE.
+
NOTE: About https://castle-engine.io/x3d_implementation_sound.php#section_x3d4[WebAudio in the context of X3D 4.0]. Supporting advanced X3D 4.0 audio nodes is not our priority, but since WebAudio will happen anyway, on the web... they will open this possibility. There is also https://github.com/LabSound/LabSound[LabSound] that provides WebAudio-like API on non-web platforms, and in principle it could one day replace OpenAL, making web and non-web audio handling closer.

- Possibly throw in additional compression of data and/or wasm executable?
+
So far, file-size tests are promising. Compilation of https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/webassm_platformer_test/examples/platformer[examples/platformer], which practically uses 100% of CGE units, yields a binary `platformer.wasm` that has 16 MB. Gzipped it has 3.4 MB.
+
The gzipped size is really what matters &mdash; both web browsers and servers support gzip-(de)compression on the fly, you can also just put ready-gzipped version on the server and tell the browser to just decompress. So in all practical cases, users will download 3.4 MB, not 16 MB.
+
Note that above is for a _release_ build. The _debug_ build weights 51 MB, and gzipped 12 MB. (Debug build contains https://wiki.freepascal.org/WebAssembly/Debugging[debugging symbols].)
+
We could also use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli[Brotli], a newer compression method also commonly supported by web browsers and servers.

- Allow to go fullscreen on web.

- Allow to use keyboard on web. (manage focus)

- Implement cgeref:TCastleDownload[] for web.

== Prerequisites

- *link:https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/[Pas2js]*.
+
You can get it along with https://www.freepascal.org/[FPC] or install it separately from link:https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/[here].
+
WARNING: We test with the latest https://wiki.freepascal.org/pas2js#GIT[Pas2js from GIT] right now, so this is also what we advise to use. The stable release 3.0.1 from https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/ is _not supported_ right now (due to incompatibilities around `Job.Js` and friends usage, which are all solved in latest Pas2js + FPC). With time we may change this (adjust to older Pas2js) and/or a new release of _Pas2js_ may happen which will make things easier :)
+
_Test that it works._ Create the following simple program, save it as `hello_pas2js.lpr`:
+
[source,pascal]
----
begin
  Writeln('Hello from pas2js!');
end.
----
+
If everything is installed and configured OK, then you should be able to compile it using this from the command-line:
+
```
pas2js -Jc -Jirtl.js -Tbrowser hello_pas2js.lpr
```
+
If everything went well, you should get a file `hello_pas2js.js` in the same directory.
+
[NOTE]
====
If `pas2js` reports an error like `Error: can't find unit "System"`, it most likely means that the https://wiki.freepascal.org/pas2js.cfg[pas2js.cfg] configuration file is missing or wrong. You can either generate it using `createconfig` tool or take and adjust the sample from https://wiki.freepascal.org/pas2js.cfg[pas2js.cfg wiki page], then place the resulting file in a system-specific location indicated on that wiki page.

It does seem that `fpcupdeluxe`, although it provides `pas2js` and `compileserver` binaries (good!), but it doesn't provide the `createconfig` tool nor does it contain the relevant pas2js package structure (you need files like `packages/rtl/system.js`). So instead get `pas2js` from https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/ and make sure it's the first on `$PATH`. TODO: Submit issue to fpcupdeluxe about it.
====

- *compileserver* from *link:https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/[Pas2js]*.
+
This is a very useful tool distributed along with link:https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/[Pas2js]. Make sure you got it, test it by executing on the  command-line this:
+
```
compileserver
```
+
Leave it running and access `http://localhost:3000/` in a web browser.
+
Kill it by _Ctrl+C_ in the terminal.
+
Why is this useful? Most dynamic webpages should be tested through a webserver running on your system (like `compileserver`, though you can also spin a full https://httpd.apache.org/[Apache] or https://nginx.org/[Nginx]) that serves the HTML, JS, WASM and other files. You view them using a `http://localhost:.../` URL, which means you access the webserver on your own system. In contrast, just opening the HTML files in a web browser (which results in URLs like `file:///.../index.html`) will usually not work, because of security: JavaScript code on such pages will not be able to load extra resources (like WASM files). It's possible to configure your browser to circumvent this (disable CORS checking) but it's a hassle. Using a "temporary webserver" like `compileserver` is the easiest way to test your applications.

- *link:https://www.freepascal.org/[FPC] with link:https://wiki.freepascal.org/WebAssembly[WebAssembly] support.*
+
In our opinion, it's easiest to get this using link:fpcupdeluxe[]: install FPC _"trunk"_ version, then install FPC cross-compiler for OS=`Wasi` and CPU=`Wasm32`. You can also just get it from GIT and compile manually, following link:https://wiki.freepascal.org/WebAssembly[FPC wiki about WebAssembly].
+
_Test that it works._ Create the following simple program, saved as `hello_wasm.lpr`:
+
```delphi
begin
  Writeln('Hello from WebAssembly!');
end.
```
+
If everything is installed and configured OK, then you should be able to compile it using this command:
+
```
fpc -Twasi -Pwasm32 hello_wasm.lpr
```
+
If everything went well, you should get `hello_wasm.wasm` in the same directory.

== How to test what we have now

Branch https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/webassm_platformer_test[webassm_platformer_test] in CGE contains the work on WebAssembly. To test it:

1. Get the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/webassm_platformer_test[webassm_platformer_test] branch of CGE.

2. Follow link:compiling_from_source.php[compiling from source] docs to compile at least new CGE build tool from this CGE branch.

3. Enter any CGE project and compile and run it for WebAssembly. For example, to compile the `examples/platformer` project:
+
[source,shell]
----
castle-engine compile --target=web --mode=debug
castle-engine run --target=web
----
+
TODO: *For now: Do not enter any project, most projects will fail* because loading `castle-data` is not implemented yet. Use examle project `examples/web/simplest` now.

== Running WASM code outside of the browser

_WebAssembly_ is not limited to running in a web browser. We support running the compiled WASM binaries also using https://wasmtime.dev/[Wasmtime], though **without rendering**.

[WARNING]
====
Trying to render anything in https://wasmtime.dev/[Wasmtime] will fail, as we don't have access to WebGL API and context (or the rest of JS API, like `window.requestAnimationFrame`). So you cannot even create cgeref:TCastleWindow[], i.e. it will fail inside https://wasmtime.dev/[Wasmtime] with

```
TODO update this error message
```

and we don't have immediate plans to make it work. But, at least everything else (all the code _up to the rendering_) will work on https://wasmtime.dev/[Wasmtime].

////
If you know of an easy way to pass WebGL API and context (and rest of JS stuff we need, like `window.requestAnimationFrame`) to application run in https://wasmtime.dev/[Wasmtime] (e.g. implementing JS APIs, including WebGL by OpenGL(ES) on the desktop), let us know. And note that we prefer to pass WebGL API, not OpenGL(ES) API, to our application run in https://wasmtime.dev/[Wasmtime]. We want the _wasmtime_ to work as close to _web browser_ as possible, 1. because it avoids `wasmtime`-specific maintenance, 2. because it makes `wasmtime` more suited to debugging what happens on the web, which is its main use-case for us.
////
====

Build your application like this (on the command-line):

```
castle-engine compile --os=wasi --cpu=wasm32 --mode=debug
```

Run it like this:

```
export WASMTIME_BACKTRACE_DETAILS=1 # get a more detailed backtrace
wasmtime <project-name>.wasm
```

The main use-case of this is additional https://wiki.freepascal.org/WebAssembly/Debugging[debugging] approach. In case of a crash, the `wasmtime` will give you a useful stack trace with line numbers (if only you compiled with `--mode=debug`, as shown above).

=== Running engine test-suite on WASM

As a particular application of the above ("you can run engine code using wasmtime, except rendering"), you can run our test suite on WASM.

WARNING: Making `castle-tester.wasm` work this way is a work-in-progress. The `time_measurements_tests.wasm` mentioned below works already.

```shell
cd tests/
castle-engine compile --os=wasi --cpu=wasm32 --mode=debug
wasmtime castle-tester.wasm --console --no-window-create

cd time_measurements_tests/ # enter tests/time_measurements_tests/ in CGE
castle-engine compile --os=wasi --cpu=wasm32 --mode=debug
wasmtime time_measurements_tests.wasm
```

[#platform_default]
== Run the project by default for the web

In the editor: Select the new platform, like _"Web"_, in the _"Run -> Platforms -> ..."_ menu. Then you can save it for the future using menu item _"Run -> Platforms -> Save Chosen Platform As Default (in Project Local Settings)"_.

Alternatively and equivalently:

You can create a file `CastleProjectLocalSettings.json` in your project. Place it at the top-level of the project, so it is next to the link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml] file. The `CastleProjectLocalSettings.json` can contain settings that are specific to your local user or machine.

For example, it can specify that the default target is _web_ like this:

```json
{
  "$$ClassName" : "TCastleProjectLocalSettings",
  "UsePlatformDefaults" : true,
  "DefaultTarget": "targetWeb"
}
```

Changing the default platform is useful if you want to always build and run for the web, without specifying `--target=web` every time. Now using just `castle-engine compile` and `castle-engine run` will build and run for the web. You can still override this at command-line, using the `--target`, `--os`, `--cpu` options (see link:build_tool[build tool] docs).

NOTE: The `CastleProjectLocalSettings.json` support is not strictly a feature of the _web target_, it's useful in every case when you want to change the default platform (and we plan to add there more things). By default, we build and run for the current desktop target, with current OS and CPU.

All the possibilities are described by the cgeref:TCastleProjectLocalSettings[].

Note that you can also open the `CastleProjectLocalSettings.json` as a _design_ in the editor and edit the component in the object inspector. That's because cgeref:TCastleProjectLocalSettings[] is a regular serializable component for our engine. Right now, this doesn't really imply any new features, but it may, and it will be compatible with future link:roadmap#_project_settings_editable_using_gui[CastleProject.json].

WARNING: The file `CastleProjectLocalSettings.json` should not be committed to the version control, it should be ignored by file like `.gitignore` (if you use GIT).

== Thank you

I want to thank everyone involved in this and let's push forward! Web target is a really cool feature, from my talks I know it's an important feature for many CGE users, and I feel we have it in our reach. Let's keep coding and enjoy making games :)
