== Introduction

[WARNING]
====
This feature is in intensive development now. As such, this page will change as we go forward. Stay tuned!
====

_Web target_ allows you to recompile any application you wrote using _Castle Game Engine_ (using cgeref:TCastleWindow[]) to the web. So you can put your application on a website, as part of a regular HTML webpage, and users can play it instantly, without the need to download / install any native application or browser plugin.

[WARNING]
====
These are _early demos_, so don't judge the final quality by these demos (yet) :) We have some known TODOs, including:

- The _"3 earliest demos"_ use only 3D / 2D things set up from code (they don't load any data files, not even designs) so they don't look impressive. Reason: When we made these demos, reading data was not implemented yet (it is implemented now).
- No shadow volumes on web yet (we need to initialize with stencil to have them).
- We don't show much 3D demos, because our PBR shaders in some cases fail compilation on WebGL. This is of course just a regular bug to find and solve.
====

== Usage (building examples and your own projects)

=== Installing Prerequisites

[NOTE]
====
Things below look complicated? We have plans to make them easier:

- We plan to extend our link:docker[Docker images] to provide pas2js and FPC with WebAssembly support out-of-the-box. Don't know yet what https://www.docker.com/[Docker] is? Then we advise to play and learn, Docker images and containers are nice way to share "development environments".

- We also will provide recipes how to use link:github_actions[Github Actions] and link:gitlab_ci[GitLab CI] to build applications for the web. So if you host your repository on _GitHub_ or _GitLab_, you can let the build be done for you.
====

Installing the tools:

- *link:https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/[Pas2js]*.
+
You can get it along with https://www.freepascal.org/[FPC] or install it separately from link:https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/[here].
+
WARNING: We test with the latest https://wiki.freepascal.org/pas2js#GIT[Pas2js from GIT] right now, so this is also what we advise to use. The stable release 3.0.1 from https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/ is _not supported_ right now (due to incompatibilities around `Job.Js` and friends usage, which are all solved in latest Pas2js + FPC). With time we may change this (adjust to older Pas2js) and/or a new release of _Pas2js_ may happen which will make things easier :)
+
_Test that it works._ Create the following simple program, save it as `hello_pas2js.lpr`:
+
[source,pascal]
----
begin
  Writeln('Hello from pas2js!');
end.
----
+
If everything is installed and configured OK, then you should be able to compile it using this from the command-line:
+
```
pas2js -Jc -Jirtl.js -Tbrowser hello_pas2js.lpr
```
+
If everything went well, you should get a file `hello_pas2js.js` in the same directory.
+
[NOTE]
====
If `pas2js` reports an error like `Error: can't find unit "System"`, it most likely means that the https://wiki.freepascal.org/pas2js.cfg[pas2js.cfg] configuration file is missing or wrong. You can either generate it using `createconfig` tool or take and adjust the sample from https://wiki.freepascal.org/pas2js.cfg[pas2js.cfg wiki page], then place the resulting file in a system-specific location indicated on that wiki page.

It does seem that `fpcupdeluxe`, although it provides `pas2js` and `compileserver` binaries (good!), but it doesn't provide the `createconfig` tool nor does it contain the relevant pas2js package structure (you need files like `packages/rtl/system.js`). So instead get `pas2js` from https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/ and make sure it's the first on `$PATH`. TODO: Submit issue to fpcupdeluxe about it.
====

- *compileserver* from *link:https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/[Pas2js]*.
+
This is a very useful tool distributed along with link:https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/[Pas2js]. Make sure you got it, test it by executing on the  command-line this:
+
```
compileserver
```
+
Leave it running and access `http://localhost:3000/` in a web browser.
+
Kill it by _Ctrl+C_ in the terminal.
+
Why is this useful? Most dynamic webpages should be tested through a webserver running on your system (like `compileserver`, though you can also spin a full https://httpd.apache.org/[Apache] or https://nginx.org/[Nginx]) that serves the HTML, JS, WASM and other files. You view them using a `http://localhost:.../` URL, which means you access the webserver on your own system. In contrast, just opening the HTML files in a web browser (which results in URLs like `file:///.../index.html`) will usually not work, because of security: JavaScript code on such pages will not be able to load extra resources (like WASM files). It's possible to configure your browser to circumvent this (disable CORS checking) but it's a hassle. Using a "temporary webserver" like `compileserver` is the easiest way to test your applications.

- *link:https://www.freepascal.org/[FPC] with link:https://wiki.freepascal.org/WebAssembly[WebAssembly] support.*
+
In our opinion, it's easiest to get this using link:fpcupdeluxe[]: install FPC _"trunk"_ version, then install FPC cross-compiler for OS=`Wasi` and CPU=`Wasm32`. You can also just get it from GIT and compile manually, following link:https://wiki.freepascal.org/WebAssembly[FPC wiki about WebAssembly].
+
_Test that it works._ Create the following simple program, saved as `hello_wasm.lpr`:
+
```delphi
begin
  Writeln('Hello from WebAssembly!');
end.
```
+
If everything is installed and configured OK, then you should be able to compile it using this command:
+
```
fpc -Twasi -Pwasm32 hello_wasm.lpr
```
+
If everything went well, you should get `hello_wasm.wasm` in the same directory.

=== Building Castle Game Engine applications

1. link:download[Download the latest Castle Game Engine] as usual.
+
Since we have merged the web target into the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master[master] branch, you don't need to do any special things to get it. But of course, if you want to "build from scratch", you can https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master[checkout the master branch using GIT] and then follow link:compiling_from_source.php[compiling from sources docs].

2. Enter any CGE project https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/deae9e6ac3f8c1dc07fc5735bae1f2cc63ad39d4/tools/internal/build_web_demos#L85[that was tested for web] and compile and run it for web.
// TODO: not until we fix PBR shader fails
// Many other examples should already work with web too, actually, so feel free to experiment.
+
You can do it using the link:editor[]. Switch the platform using _"Run -> Platform -> Web"_, then click _"Compile And Run"_ (F9).
+
Or you can do it from the command-line, using our link:build_tool[build tool]:
+
[source,shell]
----
castle-engine compile --target=web --mode=debug
castle-engine run --target=web
----

[WARNING]
====
Beware of the cache! Browsers may cache the contents of everything. We counter this to some extent, by adding a random (determined at compile-time) suffix to URLs of everything we access:

[role="compact"]
- the `index.html` (during development, we access URL like `http://localhost:3000/index.html?random_suffix_to_avoid_cache=XXX`)
- the WASM file
- the JS file
- the data ZIP file

But if you still run into cache issues (it seems like you see the previous application version, or even a different application that was run previously from the same server) -> just refresh using _Ctrl + Shift + R_.

TODO: We should make it configurable, to enable turning off "fighting with cache" for reproducible-builds that should not have random suffixes in the generated files.
====

NOTE: Our default HTML template displays link:log[] underneath your application, including everything you write to the log e.g. using `WritelnLog('Hello!')`. The log is also accessible using the _"Developer Tools"_ of your browser (press F12) -> _"Console"_ . The console can also be toggled when in the _fullscreen_ mode.

[#manifest]
=== Customize default canvas size

You can customize the default canvas size using the link:project_manifest#web[web options in CastleEngineManifest.xml].

[#platform_default]
=== Run the project by default for the web

In the editor: Select the new platform, like _"Web"_, in the _"Run -> Platforms -> ..."_ menu. Then you can save it for the future using menu item _"Run -> Platforms -> Save Chosen Platform As Default (in Project Local Settings)"_.

Alternatively and equivalently:

You can create a file `CastleProjectLocalSettings.json` in your project. Place it at the top-level of the project, so it is next to the link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml] file. The `CastleProjectLocalSettings.json` can contain settings that are specific to your local user or machine.

For example, it can specify that the default target is _web_ like this:

```json
{
  "$$ClassName" : "TCastleProjectLocalSettings",
  "UsePlatformDefaults" : true,
  "DefaultTarget": "targetWeb"
}
```

Changing the default platform is useful if you want to always build and run for the web, without specifying `--target=web` every time. Now using just `castle-engine compile` and `castle-engine run` will build and run for the web. You can still override this at command-line, using the `--target`, `--os`, `--cpu` options (see link:build_tool[build tool] docs).

NOTE: The `CastleProjectLocalSettings.json` support is not strictly a feature of the _web target_, it's useful in every case when you want to change the default platform (and we plan to add there more things). By default, we build and run for the current desktop target, with current OS and CPU.

All the possibilities are described by the cgeref:TCastleProjectLocalSettings[].
// https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/src/files/tools/castleinternalprojectlocalsettings.pas[see code]).

Note that you can also open the `CastleProjectLocalSettings.json` as a _design_ in the editor and edit the component in the object inspector. That's because cgeref:TCastleProjectLocalSettings[] is a regular serializable component for our engine. Right now, this doesn't really imply any new features, but it may in the future, and it will be compatible with future link:roadmap#_project_settings_editable_using_gui[CastleProject.json].

WARNING: The file `CastleProjectLocalSettings.json` should not be committed to the version control, it should be ignored by file like `.gitignore` (if you use GIT).

== Thank you

I want to thank everyone involved in this and let's push forward! Web target is a really cool feature, from my talks I know it's an important feature for many CGE users, and I feel we have it in our reach. Let's keep coding and enjoy making games :)

== Compatibility

Absolute :)

- The resulting application works in any modern web browser and does not require user to install anything special (like old plugins). Everything we need is already built-in in all modern web browsers, in particular https://caniuse.com/wasm[WebAssembly] and https://caniuse.com/?search=webgl[WebGL support] are completely standard now.

- All the web browsers should be good. _Firefox_, _Google Chrome_ and derivatives (like _Vivaldi_) are all good.

- Mobile web browsers are supported as well. We support touches in a way consistent with mouse events, link:touch_input[just like on non-web mobile targets]. We tested with both _Firefox_ and _Google Chrome_ on _Android_.
+
WARNING: To make the resulting web application working also in mobile (like Android) web browsers, one needs to apply a 1-line hack to `pas2js` sources, see below for details.

== Running WASM code outside of the browser

_WebAssembly_ is not limited to running in a web browser. We support running the compiled WASM binaries also using https://wasmtime.dev/[Wasmtime], though **without rendering**.

[WARNING]
====
Trying to render anything in https://wasmtime.dev/[Wasmtime] will fail, as we don't have access to WebGL API and context (or the rest of JS API, like `window.requestAnimationFrame`). So you cannot even create cgeref:TCastleWindow[], i.e. it will fail inside https://wasmtime.dev/[Wasmtime] with

```
TODO update this error message
```

and we don't have immediate plans to make it work. But, at least everything else (all the code _up to the rendering_) will work on https://wasmtime.dev/[Wasmtime].

////
If you know of an easy way to pass WebGL API and context (and rest of JS stuff we need, like `window.requestAnimationFrame`) to application run in https://wasmtime.dev/[Wasmtime] (e.g. implementing JS APIs, including WebGL by OpenGL(ES) on the desktop), let us know. And note that we prefer to pass WebGL API, not OpenGL(ES) API, to our application run in https://wasmtime.dev/[Wasmtime]. We want the _wasmtime_ to work as close to _web browser_ as possible, 1. because it avoids `wasmtime`-specific maintenance, 2. because it makes `wasmtime` more suited to debugging what happens on the web, which is its main use-case for us.
////
====

Build your application like this (on the command-line):

```
castle-engine compile --os=wasi --cpu=wasm32 --mode=debug
```

Run it like this:

```
export WASMTIME_BACKTRACE_DETAILS=1 # get a more detailed backtrace
wasmtime <project-name>.wasm
```

The main use-case of this is additional https://wiki.freepascal.org/WebAssembly/Debugging[debugging] approach. In case of a crash, the `wasmtime` will give you a useful stack trace with line numbers (if only you compiled with `--mode=debug`, as shown above).

=== Running engine test-suite on WASM

As a particular application of the above ("you can run engine code using wasmtime, except rendering"), you can run our test suite on WASM.

WARNING: Making `castle-tester.wasm` work this way is a work-in-progress. The `time_measurements_tests.wasm` mentioned below works already.

```shell
cd tests/
castle-engine compile --os=wasi --cpu=wasm32 --mode=debug
wasmtime castle-tester.wasm --console --no-window-create

cd time_measurements_tests/ # enter tests/time_measurements_tests/ in CGE
castle-engine compile --os=wasi --cpu=wasm32 --mode=debug
wasmtime time_measurements_tests.wasm
```

== How it works

- We're using FPC https://wiki.freepascal.org/WebAssembly[WebAssembly] target.
+
Huge thank you go to the whole FPC team for making it possible! For general documentation (unrelated to CGE), see https://www.freepascal.org/~michael/articles/fpcwasm1/fpcwasm1.pdf[this article by Michael Van Canneyt].

- To run the _WebAssembly_ in a web browser, there is additional "glue" code, which we also write in Pascal and compile using https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/[Pas2js].
+
The integration between https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/[Pas2js] and _FPC + WebAssembly_ is extremely easy, again thanks to the work of everyone involved!

- For development purposes, we can run a simple webserver on the localhost. link:https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/[Pas2js] features a ready `compileserver`, we just use it.
+
NOTE: https://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/fcl-web[FpWeb] also can instantiate a https://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/fphttpserver[standalone HTTP server] in just a few lines of code. But it seems we don't need even this, `compileserver` is all that we need.

- Our link:build_tool[build tool] takes care of everything. You usually want to execute 2 commands:
+
--
1. `castle-engine compile --target=web  --mode=debug`
+
This command:
+
- generates web-specific files (in `castle-engine-output/web/`),
- compiles the glue code using Pas2js,
- compiles the application code using FPC for WebAssembly.
2. `castle-engine run --target=web`
+
This command:
+
- runs web server (`compileserver`) on `http://localhost:3000/` to serve `castle-engine-output/web/dist/`,
- runs web browser (default web browser on your system, logic using our cgeref:OpenUrl[]) to open `http://localhost:3000/`.
--
+
[NOTE]
====
For some specific applications (like our `tests/`) you can also compile the regular _program_ file (like `xxx_standalone.dpr`, whatever is indicated by `standalone_source` in link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml]) using FPC + WebAssembly to a `.wasm` file using this command:

```shell
castle-engine compile --os=wasi --cpu=wasm32
```

This is _not_ equivalent to `castle-engine compile --target=web`, which generates and compiles a special _library_ file with WebAssembly (and also generates and compiles the glue code using Pas2js, and generates HTML template).

Compiling the standalone program with `castle-engine compile --os=wasi --cpu=wasm32` only makes sense if application was prepared to be run this way. E.g. it allows to run our testsuite using https://wasmtime.dev/[Wasmtime].
====

- Our link:editor[] can also build and run for web. Underneath, it just calls the build tool commands described above (which you can see in the _"Console"_).
+
Just change the platform using _"Run -> Platform -> Web"_ menu item and hit _"Build and Run"_ button or menu item (F9).
+
You can also link:#platform_default[set web platform as default].

- We create a HTML file with the `<canvas id="castle-canvas">` element (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas[canvas] docs at MDN). This HTML runs the JS code (compiled by Pas2js) that will in turn run the WASM code of your application, which will initialize and use WebGL context on this canvas.
+
This HTML file can be customized / replaced / rejected as you wish. It only needs to contain a reference to the generated JavaScript file using `<script>` and a `<canvas>` element with ID `castle-canvas`. You can surround it with any content and style.
+
For nice look, our generated HTML also uses https://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap], but again: this can be customized / removed. We don't depend on any special CSS or JS libraries.
+
Some alternative HTML templates may be available in the future, as well as the ability to provide your own template. For now, just https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/tools/build-tool/data/web/dist/index.html[(before building) customize the engine's `tools/build-tool/data/web/dist/index.html`] file or (after building) customize the generated `castle-engine-output/web/dist/index.html` (e.g. replace it with whatever contents you prefer, or edit the lines you want, manually or automatically, e.g. using `sed`).

- We use WebGL API from _WebAssembly_. All our rendering code has been adjusted to WebGL!
+
First step to do this was the https://wiki.freepascal.org/WebAssembly/DOM[JOB] units implemented in Pas2js + FPC. This is a collection of units (on both Pas2js and FPC sides) that cooperate with each other. The goal is to allow our WASM applications to access https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/tip/dom/webidl/WebGLRenderingContext.webidl[WebGL API (defined in this WEBIDL file)] plus a few other JavaScript APIs we need (for HTML canvas, `window.requestAnimationFrame` etc.).
+
NOTE: The WebGL API is available in the browser to https://getpas2js.freepascal.org/[Pas2js] (that is, any _JavaScript_ code in the browser). If not for https://wiki.freepascal.org/WebAssembly/DOM[JOB], we would expose this API for the WebAssembly, following the https://www.freepascal.org/~michael/pas2js-demos/wasienv/canvas/[canvas example] described in the 2nd part of https://www.freepascal.org/~michael/articles/fpcwasm1/fpcwasm1.pdf[this article]. But, well, using https://wiki.freepascal.org/WebAssembly/DOM[JOB] makes things even easier.
+
We generate a unit https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/src/base_rendering/web/castleinternaljobweb.pas[CastleInternalJobWeb] using this script and WEBIDLs: https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/src/base_rendering/web/webidl .
+
NOTE: FPC ships an example https://gitlab.com/freepascal.org/fpc/source/-/blob/main/packages/wasm-job/examples/job_web.pas?ref_type=heads[job_web.pas] that already contains everything we need, but it's a huge unit. It has ~184 thousands of lines and compiling it is slow (this is esp. problematic as current FPC 3.3.1 re-compiles units more often than it should -- it seems that every change even to implementation causes rebuild of everything derived, as if we changed interface). That's why we generate our own unit, https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/src/base_rendering/web/castleinternaljobweb.pas[CastleInternalJobWeb] (merely ~19 thousands of lines) that contains only what we need.
+
Second step: We then generate include file https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/src/base_rendering/web/castleinternalwebgl_flat_api.inc[castleinternalwebgl_flat_api.inc] that "flattens" the API exposed in https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/src/base_rendering/web/castleinternaljobweb.pas[CastleInternalJobWeb], making it more similar to the OpenGL ES API in the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/src/base_rendering/castlegles.pas[CastleGLES] unit. This generation also consults WEBIDL, to process all WebGL methods we need. The tool that does this is https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/tools/internal/generate_webgl_flat_api/generate_webgl_flat_api.dpr[tools/internal/generate_webgl_flat_api].
+
Third step: We then use
https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/src/base_rendering/web/castleinternalwebgl.pas[CastleInternalWebGL]
unit as (to a large extent) a drop-in replacement for the
https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/src/base_rendering/castlegles.pas[CastleGLES]
unit.
+
Lastly, we manually adjusted rendering code to account for final, unavoidable differences between OpenGL ES (https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/src/base_rendering/castlegles.pas[CastleGLES]) and WebGL (https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/src/base_rendering/web/castleinternalwebgl.pas[CastleInternalWebGL]). Mostly straightforward work, differences stem mostly from the fact that OpenGL ES is a C API (so: no such thing as `Variant`; and occasional pointer usage to pass arrays or "raw" buffers), while WebGL is a JavaScript API (so: everything is an array, even "raw" buffers; some reasonable usage of `Variant` types, like `getParameter` results). Just a small number of `{$ifdef CASTLE_WEBGL}` clauses in strategic places got the job done.
+
In the end, we render using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API[WebGL 1.0], with optional WebGL 2.0 features. This is very similar to our current rendering approach on mobile, where we use https://castle-engine.io/wp/2023/03/12/mobile-opengles-rendering-upgrades-occlusion-query-anisotropic-filtering-3d-textures-shadows-plus-new-occlusion-query-demo/[OpenGL ES 2.0, with optional OpenGL ES 3.0 features].

- Input: We handle pointer events on the canvas (down, motion, up) thus we handle mouse and touch input. We also handle key events (key down, key up) on the whole DOM window.
+
WARNING: TODO: key handling may change to rely on focus instead, to allow to e.g. have 2 web applications using CGE on the same page.

- We can switch to fullscreen. The default `index.html` features a button to do this.

- Rendering is crisp, in "real device pixels", including on high-DPI screens and when you zoom the page.

- For application data, we pack the data as one binary file (zip). This allows to download the complete data at a clearly specified moment, with a nice progress bar, and later just load data files synchronously and reliably.
+
We use our cgeref:TCastleZip[] to handle ZIP. It uses FPC and Delphi standard units.

- Fonts: If your project uses TTF / OTF / WOFF files (like link:web-demos/examples/platformer[Platformer game] (https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/platformer[Source code])):
+
Since FreeType is not available on the web, we generate an embedded font, just like when using `texture-font-to-pascal`, for all fonts found in your data at `castle-engine compile`. Then we compile the fonts in, by linking the WASM library with `CastleAutoGeneratedAllFonts` unit.
+
This approach is not final, as it has a number of problems: We assume hardcoded size (20), hardcode character set (ASCII). Also it cannot work on Windows (because build tool right now doesn't use dynamic libraries, to avoid conflicting with removal/updating of DLLs of the project). See TODO list below for plans how to improve.

== Plans (TODOs)

- PBR shaders (used by most 3D demos) combined with textures have weird error at compilation on WebGL.

- Reproduce with clean sample and submit to FPC:
+
Running on mobile requires now hacking pas2js, in `pas2js/packages/job/src/job_browser.pp`, find and comment out `RegisterGlobalObject(caches,'caches');`. Otherwise both Firefox and Chrome on Android fail with `ReferenceError: caches is not defined`.

- For audio, we will add a new sound backend using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API[WebAudio]. This will be the default sound backend on the web (like the link:openal[OpenAL] is now the default backend on non-web platforms).
+
It is also possible our link:fmod[FMOD] sound backend will also be ported to web, as https://www.fmod.com/docs/2.02/api/platforms-html5.html[FMOD supports HTML5]. This would make FMOD a truly cross-platform sound backend, working on every platform we support in CGE.
+
NOTE: About link:x3d_implementation_sound.php#section_x3d4[WebAudio in the context of X3D 4.0]. Supporting advanced X3D 4.0 audio nodes is not our priority, but since WebAudio will happen anyway, on the web... they will open this possibility. There is also https://github.com/LabSound/LabSound[LabSound] that provides WebAudio-like API on non-web platforms, and in principle it could one day replace OpenAL, making web and non-web audio handling closer.

- Possibly throw in additional compression of data and/or wasm executable?
+
WASM size: while it started smaller (compilation of https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/platformer[examples/platformer], which practically uses 100% of CGE units, yields a binary `platformer.wasm` that has 16 MB. Gzipped it has 3.4 MB.) ... but it grew larger, to 40 MB. TODO: investigate why. JOB? IFC?
+
The gzipped size is really what matters &mdash; both web browsers and servers support gzip-(de)compression on the fly, you can also just put ready-gzipped version on the server and tell the browser to just decompress. So in all practical cases, users will download 3.4 MB, not 16 MB.
//+
// Old numbers
//Note that above is for a _release_ build. The _debug_ build weights 51 MB, and gzipped 12 MB. (Debug build contains https://wiki.freepascal.org/WebAssembly/Debugging[debugging symbols].)

We could also use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli[Brotli], a newer compression method also commonly supported by web browsers and servers.

- Implement cgeref:TCastleDownload[] for web.

- Is it good we capture keys by listening to `keydown` and `keyup` events on the whole `window`? Could conflict with other things on the same page trying to handle keys (like 2nd CGE web application). Should we rather rely on canvas being focused, or maybe some canvas div wrapper? (but will need code to make it focused, because out-of-the-box canvas doesn't get any keydown / keyup).

- Save the user settings / save games (link:manual_user_prefs.php[CastleConfig]) to webpage persistent storage.

- Open / save files by browser dialog (cgeref:TCastleWindow.FileDialog[]).

- Block context menu (maybe make it optional) to allow using right mouse button comfortably?

- Handle scrollbar.

- Fix reading fonts by the build tool on Windows. Right now this is disabled because build tool right now doesn't use dynamic libraries, to avoid locking (thus preventing removal/updating) of DLLs of the project. We need to enable loading DLLs in build tool such that it will not lock project DLLs.

- Embedding fonts must be improved.

Current problems:
+
--
- High-level problem: We want to move away from "embedding things by compiling them into Pascal" like by `image-to-pascal`, `texture-font-to-pascal`.
+
Because this is causing a maintenance burden (programs and units to convert things to specialized Pascal code). It does not "scale" (e.g. to distance field fonts) because each idea would need a new converter X -> Pascal. `texture-font-to-pascal` is deprecated for above reasons.
+
And because this is unnecessary. For embedding things in EXE, FPC already has "cross-platform resources" with nice API and it just allows to embed a binary blob. And we don't even need embedding things: we have "data organized in subdirs and files" on all platforms, including the web.
+
In other words, thinking higher-level: We don't need to solve "how to embed" problem. We only need to solve "how to read the data format (efficiently, without FreeType)" problem. And in general "embedding" is a different task than "making format easier to read", we don't need "embedding things by compiling them into Pascal" to be a combined solution to both things.
--
+
What we really want is to convert the font file (TTF / OTF / WOFF) to our own font format. And keep it in `data/`. Reading this format should:
+
--
- not require anything external, like FreeType.

- be efficient.

- avoid as much run-time processing as possible. Do pre-processing earlier. E.g. we have to eliminate current processing of distance field fonts at run-time.

- be useful on all platforms. It would be easier if we didn't need to care about FreeType distribution for e.g. mobile or console targets.
--
+
So we need own font format. Actually: just serialize `TCastleFont` to JSON, this is exactly what we need, so `xxx.castle-font`. And:
+
--
- Make a dedicated editor for `TCastleFont` that, when saving, also saves font texture (distance field or not) alongside it. Just like sprite sheet editor saves atlas.
- `TCastleFont.Load` should allow reading `xxx.castle-font`, and then read texture alongside too.
