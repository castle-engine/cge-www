## What is IFC?

IFC is a standard format for storing building information models (BIM). It is used in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry.

It's an open, vendor-neutral and non-proprietary format, which means everyone has access to the full specification how everything should work and everyone can implement it. And it is supported by a lot of software:

- https://www.freecad.org/[FreeCAD], https://bonsaibim.org/[BonsaiBIM] support it as a _"first-class citizen"_, so they can load, save and internally they "think" using IFC concepts,
- popular proprietary CAD software like _Revit_, _ArchiCAD_ can export to this format too.

If you want to learn more about the IFC format, follow these links:

--

We like open 3D standards in _Castle Game Engine_ (_Michalis_ is preaching about his love for link:gltf[glTF] and link:x3d[X3D] at various link:conferences[]) so IFC naturally joins our capabilities.

## Testing

1. First of all, you can just open any supported IFC file with any of our tools. Like this:
+
Get or make a sample IFC file:
+
--
- For example take one of our testcases from https://github.com/castle-engine/demo-models/tree/master/ifc[our demo-models, ifc subdirectory].

//- For example take one of the testcases from https://github.com/buildingsmart-community/Community-Sample-Test-Files/tree/main/IFC%204.0.2.1%20(IFC%204)/ISO%20Spec%20archive[Community-Sample-Test-Files for IFC 4.x]. Rename the file from `.json` -> `.ifcjson`.

- Or create IFC file using link:blender[Blender] and https://bonsaibim.org/[BonsaiBIM] add-on, a great add-on that turns Blender into a full-featured IFC editor. Save the IFC to `.ifcjson` format.

- Or convert any IFC in STEP format (`.ifc`) to IFC in JSON format (`.ifcjson`) using https://github.com/michaliskambi/ifcJSON[Python conversion scripts (our fork with some fixes)].
--
+
Then open it using link:castle-model-viewer[Castle Model Viewer].

2. Check out the dedicated example using IFC classes to add and modify walls, that can load, save and display IFC models. It's in the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/ifc[examples/ifc/] directory of the engine sources.

## Supported IFC features

### Saving and loading

We can load and save the IFC entities listed in API docs of cgeref:CastleIfc[] unit. This includes all the classes reflecting the IFC specification (of which 178 classes have all the properties and docs, and 596 classes are only bare-bones definition for now).

All the defined IFC entities can be loaded and saved to IFC files in the JSON encoding, with the `.ifcjson` extension.

NOTE: We require to use `.ifcjson` extension for IFC files in JSON encoding, not just `.json`. That's because we also support another popular format, link:spine[Spine animations], that uses `.json` extension.

NOTE: If you're looking for conversion between `.ifcjson` and `.ifc` (STEP encoding), you can use the https://github.com/michaliskambi/ifcJSON[Python conversion scripts (our fork with some fixes)].

### Display and conversion to X3D nodes

We convert a lot of "presentational" IFC entities to X3D nodes and display them.

- A lot of IFC content is just "metadata" for our engine, that is: we load and save it, and you can use it from Pascal (by looking at IFC classes properties, or by looking at X3D nodes metadata like `MyGroup.MetadataString['IFC_Name']`, `MyGroup.MetadataString['IFC_Description']`). But it doesn't affect the display in any way.

- We load various IFC containers and lists to the corresponding X3D cgeref:TGroupNode[].

- The transformation hierarchy (following cgeref:TIfcObjectPlacement[] including cgeref:TIfcObjectPlacement.PlacementRelTo[]) is expressed using X3D cgeref:TTransformNode[].

- We display these 3D / 2D shape entities:
+
--
- lines: cgeref:TIfcPolyline[] in IFC, cgeref:TLineSetNode[] in X3D
- indexed lines: cgeref:TIfcIndexedPolyCurve[] in IFC, cgeref:TIndexedLineSetNode[] in X3D
- extrusion of a cross-section along a direction: cgeref:TIfcExtrudedAreaSolid[] in IFC, mesh (cgeref:TIndexedQuadSetNode[] for sides, cgeref:TIndexedFaceSetNode[] for top/bottom caps) in X3D
//+
//NOTE: In the past we used X3D cgeref:TExtrusionNode[] for this, but it wasn't really a good match (despite similar names) because X3D cgeref:TExtrusionNode[] adjusts rotation at spine points, causing issues in some edge-cases for IFC extrusions.
- mesh (arbitrary polygons): cgeref:TIfcPolygonalFaceSet[] in IFC, cgeref:TIndexedFaceSetNode[] in X3D
- mesh (triangles): cgeref:TIfcTriangulatedFaceSet[] in IFC, cgeref:TIndexedTriangleSetNode[] in X3D
- wireframe box: cgeref:TIfcBoundingBox[] in IFC, cgeref:TBoxNode[] in X3D (with cgeref:TAbstractShapeNode.Shading[] set to cgeref:shWireframe[])
- circle: cgeref:TIfcCircle[] in IFC, cgeref:TCircle2DNode[] in X3D
- ellipse: cgeref:TIfcEllipse[] in IFC, cgeref:TCircle2DNode[] in X3D (with cgeref:TCircle2DNode.RadiusY[] customized)
- grid: cgeref:TIfcGrid[] in IFC, just lines (colored red/green/blue, until, partially transparent) in X3D
- others: cgeref:TIfcTrimmedCurve[], cgeref:TIfcMappedItem[], cgeref:TIfcManifoldSolidBrep[], cgeref:TIfcGeometricCurveSet[], cgeref:TIfcGrid[], cgeref:TIfcConnectedFaceSet[], cgeref:TIfcBooleanResult[] (no CSG implemented yet, we just display one or both arguments), cgeref:TIfcCompositeCurve[].
--

Our conversion from IFC to X3D allows to display IFC models using _Castle Game Engine_ (using cgeref:TCastleScene[]) and allows to literally convert between model formats, from IFC to any format we can save (X3D, STL, and soon glTF).

X3D nodes can be mapped back to IFC classes, which is useful e.g. for picking 3D objects using mouse. _Castle Game Engine_ has APIs to determine what X3D node has been picked, and then you can map it back to an IFC _"product"_ (like a wall, a window, a door) using cgeref:TCastleIfcMapping.NodeToProduct[].

Our implementation targets IFC specification version 4.3, but we some made provisions to account for older specification versions too. You're welcome to report (as https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/issues[engine bugs]) any issues you find with any IFC files.

### Utilities and examples

We define some utility methods to operate on IFC classes:

- cgeref:TIfcProduct.AddMeshRepresentation[], cgeref:TIfcProduct.AddBoxRepresentation[] (adding meshes to products)
- cgeref:TIfcProduct.Translation[], cgeref:TIfcProduct.SetTransformRelativeTo[] (move products; setting the cgeref:TIfcProduct.Translation[] is properly optimized to be ultra-fast even when moving parts of very large models)
- cgeref:TIfcObjectDefinition.AddIsDecomposedBy[], cgeref:TIfcProject.BestContainer[] (relationship between larger spatial elements)
- cgeref:TIfcSpatialElement.AddContainedElement[], cgeref:TIfcSpatialElement.GetContainedElements[] (relationship to add elements (products) inside larger spatial elements)
- cgeref:TIfcElement.AddOpening[] (add openings to elements)
- cgeref:TIfcElement.AddConnected[] (add connections between elements, e.g. wall to window)
- cgeref:TIfcProject.SetupUnits[] (setup standard (metric) units for the project)
- cgeref:TIfcFile.Project[] (the main project of the IFC file)
- cgeref:TIfcProject.ModelContext[], cgeref:TIfcProject.PlanContext[], cgeref:TIfcProject.SetupModelContext[] (querying and creation of geometric contexts, necessary to designate things to be visible in "3D model view" or "2D plan" view).

These utility methods provide easy API to perform common operations, like adding and moving elements represented by transformed meshes. These utilities are not strictly necessary to build/modify IFC content, but they make some usage simpler.

Examples:

- See lower on this page for example usage of these methods to easily add walls and floors.

- Our example https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/ifc[examples/ifc/] shows the usage of these methods to make a small IFC editor in _Castle Game Engine_, that can load, save and display IFC models. The created IFC files can be then opened in other IFC tools, like _BonsaiBIM_ or _FreeCAD_.

NOTE: Let us know if you need more features related to IFC. Bug reports and PRs are welcome, as well as link:donate[donations toward the IFC support, we're happy to provide commercial support for companies too]. We're committed to IFC support. link:conferences[Michalis talks at conferences how he loves open 3D standards] --- well, IFC is one of them!

### Interchange with other IFC tools, like BonsaiBIM and FreeCAD

The IFC files saved by our engine can be opened back in other IFC tools like https://bonsaibim.org/[BonsaiBIM] and https://www.freecad.org/[FreeCAD] (after conversion from IFC JSON to STEP using https://github.com/michaliskambi/ifcJSON[Python conversion scripts]). They work regardless if you build IFC structure from scratch in our engine or load + modify some existing IFC model.

This allows to develop a specialized IFC tools in _Castle Game Engine_ that can be used in the IFC ecosystem. We can consume and produce IFC files that _"play well"_ with other software, and everything _"thinks"_ using IFC classes.

To test this, IFC files produced by our example https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/ifc[examples/ifc/] can be verified to look the same in _BonsaiBIM_ and _FreeCAD_:

cgeimg::block[
  ifc_bunny_castle.png|Bunny in glTF in Castle Game Engine,
  ifc_bunny_freecad.png|Same Bunny converted to IFC and loaded in FreeCAD
]

cgeimg::block[

  ifc_freecad.png|Same IFC example loaded in FreeCAD,
  //ifc_3.png|IFC model loaded in Castle Game Engine,
  //ifc_4.png|IFC model loaded in Castle Game Engine
]

NOTE: Above, we added some lights for display in our engine, just to make it look fancy :) These are not part of the IFC standard. There are other graphic features in our engine you could use, like link:shadow_volumes[shadows using shadow volumes], tweaking cgeref:TCastleRenderOptions.WireframeEffect[MyScene.RenderOptions.WireframeEffect].

## Loading and saving IFC in TCastleScene

Basically, you don't need to learn anything new to use IFC with _Castle Game Engine_.

Load a sample IFC file:

- using the cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.Load[] method,
- or by setting cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.Url[] property to the IFC file.

Just follow the manual page about link:viewport_and_scenes[viewports and scenes] and subsequent pages about cgeref:TCastleScene[] usage.

As always in our engine, you can modify the cgeref:TCastleScene[] contents (a set of link:x3d[X3D] nodes rooted in cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.RootNode[]). You can save it back to IFC using the cgeref:TCastleSceneCore.Save[] method.

[WARNING]
====
Using this approach to load and then save IFC _does not preserve a lof of information from the IFC file_. Converting IFC to X3D nodes (in cgeref:TCastleScene[]) will only preserve some IFC metadata and transformation hierarchy, but there's a lot of IFC details we don't keep.
// -- so _"loading is a bit lossy"_.
Saving IFC from these X3D nodes
// is even more _"lossy"_ right now, it
will result in one big cgeref:TIfcBuildingElementProxy[] entity in the IFC file. This expresses the geometry (triangles) you had -- but nothing more, for now.

Instead, *to load and then save IFC without any loss, and manipulate all the IFC information, we recommend the approach described lower*, that can work directly with IFC classes and save them using cgeref:IfcJsonSave[].
====

You can also use the cgeref:LoadNode[] and cgeref:SaveNode[] methods to load and save cgeref:TX3DRootNode[] instance, without the need for a full cgeref:TCastleScene[]. This makes sense if you don't need to display the model at all.

[NOTE]
====
The IFC files follow the convention of _"Z axis is up"_. This is different to _Castle Game Engine_ convention (consistent with link:gltf[glTF], link:x3d[X3D], and some other game engines) of _"Y axis is up"_.

Sometimes you can just ignore this difference. Everything works. Just setup your camera to look natural with _"Z up"_.

But for most projects, we advise to display IFC models to follow the _"Y up"_ convention. This will make e.g. link:physics[] works in natural way (our gravity pulls down in -Y by default). And it will make IFC models match link:gltf[glTF] and link:x3d[X3D] models better. To do this you can rotate the cgeref:TCastleScene[] instance (where the IFC model is loaded) by 90 degrees around X axis. Just set cgeref:TCastleTransform.Rotation[MyIfcScene.Rotation] to `Vector4(1, 0, 0, Deg(-90))`.
====

## Working with IFC classes (native IFC in Castle Game Engine)

There is another way to use IFC support that allows you to utilize the full power of IFC and work directly with IFC classes. All IFC entities and other types are expressed as natural Pascal classes, enums etc.

In contrast to the approach described in the previous section (_"Loading and saving IFC in TCastleScene"_), where you load and save IFC files but your _"single source of truth"_ about the model is the state of cgeref:TCastleScene[] (which means: set of link:x3d[X3D] nodes), in this new approach your _"single source of truth"_ is your hierarchy of IFC classes. This approach is also called _"native BIM"_ by various tools in the IFC ecosystem.

The advantage of this approach is that you work with the IFC concepts directly. You can modify the IFC data, and make the displayed scene to reflect the changes. So:

- You use classes from cgeref:CastleIfc[] unit, following exactly the same concepts and names as the IFC specification.

- You don't wonder _"how this metadata was mapped to X3D node"_ because you don't need to inspect X3D nodes to investigate what's inside the IFC file.

- Round-trip (read IFC, save it back) preserves exactly the input. Because you keep the cgeref:TIfcFile[] instance existing. You load to cgeref:TIfcFile[], keep it and modify it, then save it back to file.
+
In contrast, when working only with cgeref:TX3DRootNode[] and discarding the IFC-native information, the writer has to create new IFC data from X3D nodes, inside cgeref:X3DToIfc[].
// If you try to read and write back the IFC file this way,
This necessarily "drops" some information (otherwise we'd need to replicate all the IFC information using only X3D metadata, which would be a big work given lots of IFC classes and concepts that are hard to transfer both ways like IFC `PlacementRelTo`; and it would likely be unnecessary work -- since people who want to use IFC natively are better served by just using IFC classes from Pascal).
//So the export from X3D to IFC creates a new IFC file,  that is similar to the original in presentation, but does not preserve all the metadata.
//The solution is just to keep around the cgeref:TIfcFile[] instance, then round-trip is guaranteed to be perfect, always, without any effort.

To follow this approach, load IFC files using cgeref:IfcJsonLoad[]:

```pascal
var
  IfcFile: TIfcFile;
begin
  IfcFile := IfcJsonLoad('castle-data:/my_file.ifcjson');
  // ...
end;
```

and then operate on the loaded `IfcFile`, exploring the properties of cgeref:TIfcFile[] and everything inside, rooted in cgeref:TIfcFile.Project[]. The documentation of all the IFC classes is part of our API documentation: see cgeref:CastleIfc[].


Inspect and modify the properties of IFC classes as you wish. At one point, you can:

1. Save to result back to file using cgeref:IfcJsonSave[]. Like this:
+
```pascal
IfcJsonSave(IfcFile, 'output.ifcjson');
```

2. Convert the IFC to a set of X3D nodes (to display them using cgeref:TCastleScene[]) using cgeref:IfcToX3D[]. If you only want to do it once, do it like this (but if you want to do it multiple times, read next point):
+
```pascal
var
  MyRoot: TX3DRootNode;
begin
  MyRoot := IfcToX3D(IfcFile);
  MyScene.Load(MyRoot, true);
end;
```

3. You can also _load and then efficiently update multiple times_ the displayed scene (update display each time when you change the IFC classes).
+

This is done by using cgeref:TCastleIfcMapping[] class. Like this:
+
```pascal
var
  IfcFile: TIfcFile;
  IfcMapping: TCastleIfcMapping;
  Wall: TIfcWall;
begin
  IfcFile := IfcFromJson('castle-data:/my_file.ifcjson');
  try
    IfcMapping := TCastleIfcMapping.Create;
    try
      // convert IfcFile to X3D, in a way that allows to efficiently update it later
      IfcMapping.Load(IfcFile, 'castle-data:/');

      // display the result using MyScene:TCastleScene; it will own the IfcMapping.RootNode
      MyScene.Load(IfcMapping.RootNode, true);

      // modify IfcFile, e.g. add a new wall
      Wall := TIfcWall.Create(IfcFile);
      Wall.AddBoxRepresentation(IfcFile.Project.ModelContext,
        Box3D(
          Vector3(0, 0, 0),
          Vector3(10, 0.5, 2) // Z is "up", by convention, in IFC
        ));
      Wall.Translation := Vector3(1, 2, 0);
      IfcFile.Project.BestContainer.AddContainedElement(Wall);

      // modify the contents of RootNode, to reflect above new wall.
      // the MyScene displaying it will automatically reflect the changes
      IfcMapping.Update(IfcFile);
    finally FreeAndNil(IfcMapping) end;
  finally FreeAndNil(IfcFile) end;
end;
```

Consult the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/ifc[examples/ifc/] example application (in the engine sources) for a full code following this approach.

## TODO: Possible future work

NOTE: Do you want the features described below to happen? Please link:donate[donate towards the IFC support]. We're open to support from the community (https://www.patreon.com/castleengine[e.g. through Patreon]) as well as business cooperation (contact `michalis@castle-engine.io`).

Easier tasks:

- Ability to toggle which representation (3D model, 2D plan) is displayed. We have the necessary information (which object comes from what representation) already.

- Support for textures and per-vertex colors. Support from the authoring tools, like _BonsaiBIM_, to define them would help (it seems that _BonsaiBIM_ doesn't support textures yet? if this is not true, please point us to docs/video showing how to use them).

- Cross sections with holes (`IfcArbitraryProfileDefWithVoids.InnerCurves`) support.

- More curves support:
+

- Surfaces:

https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4_3/HTML/lexical/IfcRationalBSplineCurveWithKnots.htm[IfcRationalBSplineCurveWithKnots].
--

Harder tasks:

- Optimize more how the changes to IFC update the display (X3D graph). Internally, changing translation and adding new items could be _much_ optimized in how they map to X3D. The cgeref:TCastleIfcMapping.Update[] already tries to be "_smart_" but testing it on large/complicated IFC models showed that we still have some way to go to be really optimal.

- STEP encoding support (`.ifc` files).

- Boolean operations (CSG) on IFC entities, likely using https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/specification__boolean_operations.html[Open CASCADE]. For now, we show the openings (using a wireframe display for opening geometry, and partial transparency for the container geometry) but we don't actually subtract the opening geometry from the container geometry.
