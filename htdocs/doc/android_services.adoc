== Introduction

cgeimg::block[android-components-icons.png|Android Services]

When you package your game for Android, you can easily add _services_ to the project. They allow to comfortably access various Android services (from Google and other 3rd parties, like ad networks) from your Object Pascal game code using the https://castle-engine.io/[Castle Game Engine].

The Android services are declared in link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml] like this:

[source,xml]
----
<android>
  <services>
    <service name="google_play_services" />
    <service name="google_in_app_purchases" />
  </services>
</android>
----

== How it works

While the base _Castle Game Engine_ activity on Android uses `NativeActivity`, we add Java code to integrate with additional services you request.

The link:build_tool[build tool] will automatically create Android project that contains all the necessary services, and it will invoke Android tools to build and run it.

== Default features of integrated projects

Even if you don't add any services explicitly, by default the following features are available:

* _Immersive mode_. This is a "true" full-screen mode for games on Android, where the back/home buttons are usually hidden.

* You can open URLs in external applications using cgeref:OpenURL[].
+
NOTE: Open special `market://` URL on Android to send users to the _Google Play_ store, e.g. to rate your application.

* You can share text and links with other applications using cgeref:ShareText[]. This allows to e.g. propose users to send a message with a link to your game to their friends.

* You can send Android standard on-screen notification ("toast") using cgeref:OnScreenNotification[].

* Some services (like `sound` and `ogg_vorbis`) will be added automatically to your project if the sound files are detected in your game data.
