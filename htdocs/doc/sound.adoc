== The most important classes and their usage

]

- cgeref:TCastleSound[]: The most important class, use this always when you want to play any sound.
+
This is a non-visual component that represents a sound file with some playback parameters. The most important properties are:
+
--
- cgeref:TCastleSound.Url[] -- set this to load the given sound file.

- cgeref:TCastleSound.Stream[] --  optionally use "streaming", which is an alternative loading method best suited for longer playing sounds (like music tracks).

- cgeref:TCastleSound.Volume[] -- how loud the sound is. This is multiplied by volume at cgeref:TCastlePlayingSound.Volume[] and cgeref:TCastleSoundSource.Volume[] and by spatial calculations.

- cgeref:TCastleSound.Pitch[] -- sound playing speed. As with volume, the volume of cgeref:TCastleSound.Pitch[] is multiplied by similar parameters controlled at cgeref:TCastlePlayingSound.Pitch[] and cgeref:TCastleSoundSource.Pitch[].
--
+
cgeref:TCastleSound[] by itself doesn't manage playing the sound. You have to use cgeref:TSoundEngine.Play[SoundEngine.Play] to play the sound (the simplest way to play, for non-spatial sounds) or cgeref:TCastleSoundSource[] (for sounds that can be spatial; assign to cgeref:TCastleSoundSource.Sound[] for looping, or use cgeref:TCastleSoundSource.Play[] for non-looping.

- cgeref:TCastleSoundSource[]: A way to play spatial (3D) sounds.
+
This is a link:behaviors[behavior] that enhances any cgeref:TCastleTransform[] so that it emits (possibly spatial) sounds.
+
cgeref:TCastleSoundSource[] refers to cgeref:TCastleSound[] for an actual sound information. There are two ways to use it:
+
--
1. Set a looping sound in cgeref:TCastleSoundSource.Sound[]. The sound source will play it automatically. Turn it on or off using cgeref:TCastleSoundSource.SoundPlaying[].

2. Play a sound calling cgeref:TCastleSoundSource.Play[]. You can pass any cgeref:TCastleSound[] or even your own cgeref:TCastlePlayingSound[] to observe the playback.
--
+
You can use both methods to play sounds. This way cgeref:TCastleSoundSource[] can play multiple sounds at the same time.

- cgeref:TCastlePlayingSound[]: Optional, use if you need more control before and during the sound playback.

Both cgeref:TCastleSoundSource[] and cgeref:TCastleSound[] can be created, configured and linked in the link:editor[CGE editor], e.g. when designing your state. You can hear the 3D sounds in the editor. You can also create and control them from code, as all CGE components.

== Examples

//  array('filename' => 'sound_example_player.png', 'titlealt' => 'Example audio player'),
//  array('filename' => 'sound_example_doppler.png', 'titlealt' => 'Doppler demo'),

- See all the examples in https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/audio[examples/audio] subdirectory.

- In particular open the https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/audio/game_3d_sound[examples/audio/game_3d_sound] demo. It's a simple example of how cgeref:TCastleSoundSource[] and cgeref:TCastleSound[] can be set up in the CGE editor.

- See also https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/platformer[examples/platformer] as a demo how to design a _collection of sounds_ (see below for details).

== Editor sound features

cgeimg::float[
  sound_editor_options.png|Sound editor options
]

- Sound volume, and _"Auto-mute on play"_ are available in the editor settings.

- Drag-and-drop sound files on the viewport to automatically create a spatial sound: cgeref:TCastleTransform[], cgeref:TCastleSoundSource[], cgeref:TCastleSound[].

== Playing sound from Pascal code

Load a sound file as cgeref:TCastleSound[] like this:

1. Add cgeref:CastleSoundEngine[] unit to your uses clause.

2. Declare variable to hold it like `MySound: TCastleSound;`

3. Initialize the variable and load sound file, e.g. in `Application.OnInitialize`:
+
[source,pascal]
----
MySound := TCastleSound.Create(Application);
MySound.Url := 'castle-data:/my-sound.wav';
----

4. Play the sound like this:
+
[source,pascal]
----
SoundEngine.Play(MySound);
----

See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/audio/simplest_play_sound/simplest_play_sound.dpr[source code of examples/audio/simplest_play_sound/simplest_play_sound.dpr] for a working simplest possible example of this.

NOTE: https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/audio/simplest_play_sound/simplest_play_sound.dpr[simplest_play_sound] example is literally the simplest application that only plays a sound, without displaying anything. In a real situation, you want to use such code to play sound inside a larger CGE application, e.g. play sound when user presses some key, using our link:view_events[view events].

== Using sounds collection (.castle-component file)

cgeimg::float[
  sound_collection.png|Sounds collection designed in editor
]

It is often comfortable to define a _collection_ of sounds, which means that each sound file is assigned a simple name and configuration (e.g. priority, default volume), and all the sound files can be loaded easily from any place in code (regardless of the current link:views[view]).

Do it by using a cgeref:TCastleComponent[] as a design root and adding cgeref:TCastleSound[] children. Save the resulting design to a file like `sounds.castle-component`.

See also https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/platformer[examples/platformer] for an example of this approach. In particular, important files in this example are:

- https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/platformer/data/sounds.castle-component[examples/platformer/data/sounds.castle-component] describes all sounds. Edit this JSON file visually in CGE editor, just double-click on it in the CGE editor _"Files"_ panel.

- https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/platformer/code/gamesound.pas[examples/platformer/code/gamesound.pas] loads them. It defines a simple `NamedSound` routine used by the rest of code to play sounds like `SoundEngine.Play(NamedSound('something'))`.

== Sound backends

cgeimg::float[
  sound_fmod.png|FMOD
]

By default we use _OpenAL_ to play sounds. It's a great full-featured open-source audio library, perfect match for our open-source game engine.

You can alternatively switch to use the https://castle-engine.io/fmod[FMOD sound backend]. This is just an option. FMOD is proprietary (not open-source) and https://www.fmod.com/licensing[commercial (though free in some cases, for indie developers)].

- Main advantage of FMOD in CGE for now is link:nintendo_switch[Nintendo Switch compatibility].

- Big future advantage will be integration with the https://www.fmod.com/studio[FMOD Studio]. The goal of _FMOD Studio_ is to make the work of _sound designer_ easier. The sfx person can create sound effects in _FMOD Studio_, in a way that is agnostic to the game engine, and the code (like your game) simply sends _"events"_ that may cause some sound effect (playing something, stopping something, fading in/out something...).
