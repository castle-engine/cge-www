== Setting up the Linux and Delphi environment

NOTE: This information is not specific to _Castle Game Engine_. You may find it useful for any Linux development with Delphi.

In general, to deploy (build and run) Linux applications from Delphi (which runs on Windows), you need to

- Have a working network connection from Windows to Linux.

- Install on Linux the https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Alexandria/en/Installing_the_Platform_Assistant_on_Linux[PA Server] (Platform Assistant Server).

- Connect from Delphi IDE to Linux.

- Install FMXLinux in Delphi.

=== Make sure your Delphi supports Linux

First of all, you need https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/product-editions[Delphi Enterprise] to have a Linux support. Make sure you have checked the _"Linux"_ platform during the installation process.

Note that _{Cpp} Builder_ does not support the Linux target.

=== Installing Linux, regular or in WSL

You can use any Linux distribution and install it on any system:

- You can use a regular, separate computer with Linux. We advise this to new users -- just get https://ubuntu.com/download/desktopp[Ubuntu for Desktop] and install it on a separate computer. This is the easiest way to get started with Linux.
+
NOTE: We recommend this option especially for people who are not experienced with using Linux. You may be tempted to use some virtualization solution, and they indeed rock (see below), but using them requires some experience to deal with extra steps (e.g. to make sure modern OpenGL works with decent speed -- and you will need this to run CGE applications). If you're new to Linux, it will really be a smoother experience if you  just install Linux in a regular way, on a dedicated machine.

- Or you can set up a virtual machine using "full" virtualization software like https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox].

- Or you can use https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)] to setup a comfortable Linux environment on Windows. This is a great option if you know your way around Linux and can use it from the command-line. WSL gives you a really lightweight and comfortable Linux virtual machine within your Windows.
+
For example set WSL machine with latest Ubuntu by just:
+
```
wsl --install # gets ubuntu latest
```
+
Later, use just `wsl` command to enter the virtual Linux environment. If the machine doesn't run yet (e.g. after Windows reboot) it will be automatically started.
+
Within the machine, you have full Linux system. Inspect it, upgrade it and install additional software as usual, e.g.:
+
```bash
lsb_release -A
sudo apt update
sudo apt dist-upgrade
sudo apt install mesa-utils
glxinfo -B
glxgears # make sure OpenGL works
```
+
Note to Nvidia users: You may need to use `export MESA_D3D12_DEFAULT_ADAPTER_NAME=nvidia` . You can add it to `~/.bashrc` to make it permanent.

=== Libraries required (for both development and runtime)

- OpenGL (_essential_, to be able to render)
- GTK 3 (_essential_, to open a window using FMX or cgeref:TCastleWindow[])
- EGL (_essential_, to be able to initialize rendering context, either by cgeref:TCastleWindow[] or cgeref:TCastleControl[])
- LibCurl (to be able to use HTTP(S) protocol with cgeref:TCastleDownload[]; as of Delphi 11.3, these version are supported: `libcurl3`, `libcurl4`, `libcurl5`).
- LibPng (to open png files more efficiently)
- ZLib (to unpack gzip files; also used by LibPng)
- OpenAL (to play sound)
- FreeType (to load font files)
- VorbisFile (to load OggVorbis files)

On _Debian_ and derivatives (like _Ubuntu_ or _Raspberry Pi OS_), this command should install them all:

```bash
sudo apt install mesa-utils libgtk-3-dev libegl1 libcurl4 libpng-dev libz1 libopenal1 libfreetype6 libvorbisfile3
```

Note that users do not need the `-dev` versions of these libraries.

NOTE: The above list already contains the relevant subset of https://castle-engine.io/compiling_from_source.php#section_Linux,_FreeBSD[libraries used by CGE when compiled with FPC].

All these libraries are common and should be available out-of-the-box on any modern Linux distribution with any graphical environment installed.

=== Installing PA Server

Follow the https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Alexandria/en/Installing_the_Platform_Assistant_on_Linux[PA Server] docs how to install and run it on Linux.

Note that it may report issues with `libpython3.so` version. Fix it by commands like this:

```bash
# The directory below may be different for you, depending on where you unpacked the PA Server
cd ~/PAServer/lldb/lib

# See if the symlink looks valid
ls -Flah libpython3.so

# If the symlink looks invalid, move it away (you could also "rm -f libpython3.so" if feeling brave)
mv libpython3.so libpython3.so.old

# Setup proper symlink.
# Check the actual libpython3.XXX version below on your system first!
ls /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3*
ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.11.so.1 libpython3.so
```

Remember the directory where you unpacked the _PA Server_. Delphi will automatically _deploy_ Linux applications there, which means that it will copy the binaries and data into the directory like `~/PAServer/scratch-dir/<connection-name>/<project-name>/`. If need be, you *can* later run the applications directly, on that Linux machine, without using Delphi, just from command-line entering the directory and running the binary, like

```bash
cd ~/PAServer/scratch-dir/<connection-name>/my_project/
./my_project
```

=== Connect from Delphi to Linux

In Delphi IDE, go to _"Options" -> "Deployment" -> "Connection Profile Manager"_. Add a new connection to the Linux machine -- real, or virtual, doesn't matter. You just need to provide the IP address of the Linux machine.

You also need to provide the username and password to connect to the PA Server running on it.

To link applications on Linux, Delphi needs to have a local copy of the Linux libraries. It is critical that after you install or upgrade any library on Linux, in Delphi you go to _"Options" -> "Deployment" -> "SDK Manager"_ and run _"Update Local File Cache"_.

=== Get and install FMXLinux

To compile _Castle Game Engine_ applications using Delphi for Linux, you need to have _FireMonkey for Linux_ (https://www.fmxlinux.com/[FMXLinux]) installed in the Delphi IDE and properly configured.

Use RAD Studio _GetIt Package Manager_ to install `FMXLinux`. Follow the https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Sydney/en/FireMonkey_for_Linux[FireMonkey for Linux using GetIt] instructions for details.

You can also https://my.embarcadero.com/#downloadsPage[download FMXLinux from Embarcadero "My Downloads" page]. Then you can use GetIt _"Load Local Package"_ feature.

NOTE: Local packages from https://my.embarcadero.com/#downloadsPage[Embarcadero "My Downloads"] come with units precompiled for a specific Delphi version. Pay attention to download the version proper for your Delphi. E.g. _"FMXLinux Package Download for RAD Studio 12.0"_ contains _FMXLinux 1.76_ with unis for Delphi 12.0. Installing it in Delphi 11.3 will result in problems -- it will seem to install OK, but then compilation of any FMX application for Linux will fail with _"Could not compile used unit 'FMX.Forms'"_. To work with Delphi 11.3, you need to download _"FMXLinux Package Download for RAD Studio 11.3"_. If you mess things up, you may need to manually cleanup the directory like `C:\Users\Public\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\22.0\CatalogRepository\FmxLinux-1.76_Local` , in case GetIt UI doesn't allow to uninstall packages when the GetIt website is offline, which https://blogs.embarcadero.com/we-are-experiencing-a-hardware-outage/[happens].

NOTE: With Delphi 11.2 (Enterprise), it seems GetIt cannot find "FMXLinux". Just upgrade to 11.3 in you experience this issue. Or use https://my.embarcadero.com/#downloadsPage[Embarcadero "My Downloads"] to download FMXLinux for Delphi 11.2.

NOTE: You can also https://www.fmxlinux.com/[buy FMXLinux]. There is also a free trial. See https://www.fmxlinux.com/guide.html[FMXLinux installation instructions]. But, practically, if you already have Linux platform, then you should also have Delphi Enterprise, and then you should be able to install FMXLinux without any additional cost using GetIt.

Once you have _FireMonkey for Linux_ installed, you should see that "_Linux 64-bit_" becomes a possible platform for FMX projects.

Be sure to also install required libraries in your Linux. Follow https://www.fmxlinux.com/guide.html for the appropriate `apt install ...` command to execute. We found it useful to add also `sudo apt install libgtk3.0-dev`. As usual after installing libraries on Linux, refresh the cache: enter Delphi _"Options"_ dialog, inside find _"Deployment -> SDK Manager"_, select the Linux platform, and _"Update Local Cache"_ (answer _"Yes To All"_ in case it asks whether to override files).

Test FMXLinux by installing _"FMX Linux Samples"_ using GetIt (these are available for everyone, regardless of how you obtained FMXLinux above). Run some of them to test that FMX on Linux works.

NOTE: _GtkWindow_ sample from FMXLinux has a bug, that prevents compilation due to permissions. Edit fhe project settings and change "Unit Output Directory" from `$(fmxlinux)\Lib\$(ProductVersion)\$(Config)` to `.\$(Platform)\$(Config)`. Or try a different sample, like _FontList_.

[#library_paths]
=== Optional: Add FMXLinux redistributables to "Library Paths"

NOTE: This step is optional. It's not required to build CGE applications for Linux, using Delphi. It's not required to use `TCastleWindow` or `TCastleControl`. It's not required to install CGE packages in Delphi IDE.

If you want to build CGE packages that use FMX for the _"Linux 64-bit"_ platform, to use them as run-time packages in Linux, do this:

- Enter _"Tools -> Options"_ dialog
- Go to _"Language -> Delphi -> Library -> Library Path"_
- Add the `$(BDSCatalogRepositoryAllUsers)\FmxLinux-1.74\Redist` path to the list. See the screenshot below.

The exact path may differ based on _FMXLinux_ version.

=== Test blank FMX application

We advise to test everything above by creating a blank FMX application (_"File -> New -> Multi-Device Application"_), and compiling and running it on Linux. If this works, you know you have everything set up correctly.

== Test Castle Game Engine on Delphi/Linux

Simply open in Delphi any example, switch to platform on top to _Linux 64-bit_, and hit F9 (compile and run) from Delphi.

All our examples are compatible with Delphi on Linux. This includes

- Examples using cgeref:TCastleWindow[], our recommended approach to develop games with _Castle Game Engine_, where the engine controls the entire application window. Most CGE examples use it, test e.g. https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/eye_of_beholder[examples/eye_of_beholder], https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/platformer[examples/platformer].

- Examples using cgeref:TCastleControl[] based on FMX. Test e.g. https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/delphi/fmx[examples/delphi/fmx] and https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/delphi/fmx_play_animation[examples/delphi/fmx_play_animation].

== Special things to watch out for when using Delphi for Linux with CGE

=== Data files deployment (applies to all non-Windows platforms with Delphi)

When "deploying" your application (e.g. when you hit F9 in Delphi to run on Linux), Delphi needs to know which data files to copy to the target (Linux). This is particularly important for the link:manual_data_directory.php[data directory] of your project, it needs to be available on target. Unfortunately, we cannot tell Delphi to just _"copy whole `data` directory recursively"_ in the project deployment settings.

To make it work, our link:editor[] and link:build_tool[build tool] can generate in the DPROJ (project settings) the list of files to copy, by listing all current files in the data directory.

So we highly advise to manage your project files (DRPOJ) automatically, and just use _"Code ->Regenerate Project"_ menu item from the link:editor[] whenever you add / remove some files in your data directory.

See at Delphi window _"Project -> Deployment"_ to confirm that Delphi is aware of all your data files.

=== Use TCastleControl.ApplicationRun (instead of Application.Run) in FireMonkey applications

Due to technical limitations, you cannot just use `Application.Run` in FMX (FireMonkey) applications that you want to run on Linux if you want to have reliable cgeref:TCastleControl[]. You need to replace it (usually in the main program file) with

```pascal
TCastleControl.ApplicationRun;
```

Add to the uses clause the `Fmx.CastleControl` unit where it is defined. https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/delphi/fmx/CastleFmx.dpr#L48p[Like this].

On Windows, this is equivalent to just doing `Application.Run`. On Linux, this does the event loop in more special way, to ensure engine updates and rendering can happen reliably.

All our FMX examples (like https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/delphi/fmx[examples/delphi/fmx] and https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/delphi/fmx_play_animation[examples/delphi/fmx_play_animation]) already do this. Remember to do this in your own FMX applications too.

Moreover, if you ever call `Application.ProcessMessages;` to perform manual loop control in your FMX application, you should extend it to call CGE processing too:

```pascal
while Something do
begin
  Application.ProcessMessages;
  TCastleControl.ProcessTasks; // additional CGE processing
end;
```

Additional notes:

- The `TCastleControl.ApplicationRun` (and `TCastleControl.ProcessTasks`) work even if your application does not use cgeref:TCastleControl[]. Or if your application doesn't use it on all forms or all the time.

- We have tried to avoid this non-standard need and make just `Application.Run` work for CGE applications. But it really seems unavoidable with current _FMXLinux_. See `USE_TIMER` comments in https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/src/window/castlewindow_form.inc[castlewindow_form.inc] and https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/src/delphi/fmx.castlecontrol.pas[fmx.castlecontrol.pas]. With `Application.Run`, there seems to be no reliable way to perform some work independent of user input (like update animations) many times per second, on _FMXLinux_.

- As a consequence of this workaround, FMX applications (using `TCastleControl.ApplicationRun`) will always report this GTK error on exit:
+
```
...: Gtk-CRITICAL **: ...: gtk_main_quit: assertion 'main_loops != NULL' failed
```
+
You have to simply ignore this GTK error. It doesn't break the execution flow, in particular code after `TCastleControl.ApplicationRun` executes normally.
+
The reason is that _FMXLinux_ `Application.Terminate` uses `gtk_main_quit`, but it should not be used when `gtk_main` is not called. And indeed `gtk_main` is not called when we don't call `Application.Run`. When you use cgeref:TCastleWindow[], we can adjust to it, by not using `Application.Terminate` at all. But when using cgeref:TCastleControl[], we cannot avoid it being called when last window gets closed.

== Known Limitations

=== optirun (useful on some laptops with 2 GPUs) doesn't affect Delphi applications

For unknown reason, using `optirun`, like `optirun ./play_animation` to force the application to use dedicated GPU (like Nvidia) doesn't affect Delphi applications.

Reason is unknown at this point. Notes about things we considered:

- We use the same OpenGL header (`CastleGL` based on `dglOpenGL`) and even load OpenGL library in the same way (`CastleDynLib`) on FPC and Delphi.

- Exporting `NvOptimusEnablement` on Delphi/Linux doesn't change anything. It is possible, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15372931/force-system-with-nvidia-optimus-to-use-the-real-gpu-for-my-application[this answer], but doesn't affect anything on Linux (doesn't change the default GPU, doesn't change whether `optirun` works). This is similar to FPC (where `NvOptimusEnablement` needs to be exported differently, but it also doesn't actually change anything on Linux, in our tests).

- We tested changing `CastleDynLib` to handle shared libraries using directly `dlopen` / `dlsym` / `dlclose`, with and without `RTLD_GLOBAL`. (In case Delphi's `LoadLibrary` did something non-standard on Linux.) It didn't change anything -- that is the resulting applications worked OK, but remained "invulnerable" to `optirun`.

=== "Loading" text is not displayed during Application.OnInitialize work

On other platforms (like Windows) or other compilers (like FPC), if you use cgeref:TCastleWindow[] and put some work in `Application.OnInitialize`, then we display a simple screen with _"Loading"_ text when it happens. https://castle-engine.io/loading_image[Its look is configurable by adjusting colors or images.]

Unfortunately, on Delphi/Linux, the _"Loading"_ is not visible. Instead the application shows either a completely black window, or the window is not even visible before we finish `Application.OnInitialize` callback.

There's no solution for now, it's just a consequence of how FMXLinux works. Presumably, the same problem with happen if you put some work in `Form.OnCreate` in any FMX application, regardless of CGE, regardless of using cgeref:TCastleControl[] or cgeref:TCastleWindow[]. The FMX window is not drawn soon enough to show some UI.

Eventually, once we adjust GTK backend of cgeref:TCastleWindow[] to Delphi, we will avoid using FMX in this case, and then we will control the window initialization completely -- and the problem will be solved.
